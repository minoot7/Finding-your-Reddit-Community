1,1,1,1,Need help on becoming a better runner.,1602036498,"So this post is exactly what the title states. I’ll list some of my running stats and hopefully someone can assist me in increasing my endurance and time.


I have been running seriously for a few months now. I’ve lost 40lbs so far this year running/working out. 

Right now my fastest mile time is 8:35. My longest distance I’ve run fully is 2 miles though. My endurance is not great at all. I have asthma and allergies so when I run my throat and nostrils tend to become very dry. I always feel that my shins/calves are the first things to become fatigued when running. I do think I need to consider drinking more water, but I get stomach pain when I do. 

I try to run/workout in the morning at 6am so it is hard for me to hydrate before a run without getting side stitches. I also sometimes feel my stomach get this “full” feeling. Not sure if it’s gas or what but it happens a lot. Sort of like a heavy feeling in the stomach. It makes me get cramps in my stomach some days and it’s difficult to run. I feel my stomach and legs are the two things holding me back from running longer. 

I was hoping someone could give me some tips on how to keep my airways less dry so that I can run for a longer distance. Also any tips on the leg fatigue? I feel I can run a lot more if I get this under control. 

I like to run a lot because it is such a great stress reliever for me, but I am always stressing during the run about the distance and time now. I feel if I’m not improving then I’m either getting worse or staying the same so I like to challenge myself. I want to run/workout 5-6 times a week. If you need anymore information please let me know.

Any tips work for me. Thank you.",running,DatNiqqa34,False,/r/running/comments/j6ij2s/need_help_on_becoming_a_better_runner/
2,2,2,2,"Committed ""Casual"" - What Can be Accomplished in 3 1hr sessions/week?",1602036383,"This sub seems bi-modal: most of the posts are either about encouraging folks in the C25K crowd or about marathons / ultra marathons and targeting 50 miles per week or more.  Both great to read/post about but I suspect there's a lot of us on the sub that don't fit either category.  

In my case, I'm probably committed to no more than 15 miles / week for quite some time.  I have about 1 hour to exercise on each of 6 days out of the week, and I must spend about half of those days on strength training.  My question is what to expect can be accomplished with 1 hr sessions 3 days per week?  As a military man it would be great to be super fast at 1.5 miles, and my secondary goals are to be decent at the 5K and to have decent stamina in recreational soccer games (after we can do that sort of thing again).  

I don't seem to fit the Running Order of Operations.  I'm at 3 days per week, 4 miles at a time, averaging about 6mph, including about 20% of my laps at 8.0mph and the other 80% at 5.6mph.  I can spend a little more time on Saturdays and will work my way up to 6-7 miles.

3,3,3,3,Wanting to change from a power lifter to a runner,1602035235,"So I’ve mostly been overweight as far as BMI goes. I played linebacker in highschool so mostly muscle but still technically heavy for my height. I’m 6’1 230lbs and I’m looking to focus less on the heavy weights life and get into running. Right now I can run a mile with somewhat ease at about 8 minutes. I want to be able to run around 5:30/6 minute miles with that same effort. 

I’ve heard from friends that weigh about 120lbs and ran cross country complain about how much they height lifting weights where I prefer it. I’m guessing a lot of this has to do with what our muscles are used to by how we train. I am also guessing it has a lot to do with how much I weigh. So I’m on a mission now to get down to 180lbs within the next couple of months. I’m pretty good at gaining and losing weight so I don’t see this being an issue. 

I guess my real question is, how much will losing 50lbs change my ease of running and how do you all think I should train to get myself down to low times and also running 6-8 miles at a time?

7,7,7,7,Today I reclaimed the route where I broke my leg 7 months ago.,1602032811,"In early March, I caught a patch of ice hiding under some fresh snow and slipped.  One of my legs went out from under me as I expected, but the other one caught on some pavement and stayed under me.  Two separate aural cues (as in, a crack-SNAP) told me my leg was broken before I hit the ground.  Open fracture\*.  Immediate surgery the same day.  A plate and four screws in my fibula, and I was off my feet until June.

Today, my mileage has brought me back up to 6 miles in a single go, and I finally was able to run the loop this morning where the accident occurred 7 months ago--it felt great to be back there!  It hasn't been an easy road--I lost almost my entire college career's worth of conditioning, and I've gone from hobbling through a mile and a half to possibly being able to ski my third Birkie in February (COVID allowing).

To anyone dealing with injury--hang in there!  It's a slow, procedural road to get back, but it's been interesting to retread some of the struggles I had the first time I really got into shape (I'm getting blisters on my feet in places where I haven't had them in 15 years)--and, I have to say it feels just as rewarding the second time around!

### Training

I started running at the beginning of September. I wasn't training for any particular distance, just wanted to improve my base level of fitness. Weekly routine consisted of 4 runs per week: three 5ks and one 4 miler - all at a very easy pace (10 min/mile).

### Pre-race

Nothing special here. Did some stretching, changed into my running gear and took off!

### Race

The first two miles felt great. Started to feel it at the start of the third mile, and really felt it at the small hill I had to climb in the last half mile. Overall I'm thrilled with my time, it was far better than I was expecting.

### Post-race

Taco bowl! All that needs to be said.

Then I tried lifting again but my strength never recovered. Then a year later as I was stressed in my personal life I began training for another annual half marathon probably with a caloric deficit but then had a traumatic stalking experience that brought up childhood ptsd and panic attacks. 

Then a year and a half ago - my panic attacks accompanied with a lot of supplements to improve my health (I’ll-advised) led to a ton of GI issues (regurgitating in digested food, blooming, alternating frequent and infrequent bowels), sleep maintenance insomnia (can’t stay asleep), daily fatigue and no motivation or energy to do much but I kept working out 6x a week at the gym. 

Then it got so bad in January of 2020 I completely stopped working out and the panic attacks and other mental health anxiety symptoms got worse under covid. Between therapy, good nutrition, and rest I felt fairly good by July and began working out relatively hard 3-4x/week. After a month of that my sleep became difficult again and my symptoms came back. 

I do go to therapy for anxiety and ptsd symptoms.  

Current symptoms:

- sleep maintenance insomnia
- daily fatigue/lack of energy/motivation 
- leg aches/soreness (radiates below knee to feet)
- tinnitus related to clenching jaw/shoulders grinding teeth at night

My best time so far is 6min45seconds. I have one main question for those who have done it: About what point do your legs start ""feeling like jello""?  

I get to the point at about .75 miles where I feel like I have to decide to like shut off my brain and ignore any feelings in my legs, but I am worried about risking injury because I won't be able to focus on having good running form and also I might just take a really hard stumble because I'll get to the point where i lose all control of my muscles. So when y'all did it was the last 25% of the run about pushing through jello legs, or were you able to do 1 mile without getting jello legs?  

Also my current regiment is running 1.2 miles trying to maintain a balance of having a long stride and landing on my feet in between the balls and arch.

I am running with a heart rate strap and am using my watch to set HR zones based on threshold rate (top of Z4 is 186), so although not perfect, I feel they are as accurate as I'm going to get them without doing a proper test. I'm 31 and my max heart rate is quite high (about 210). I've never really concentrated on my heart rate until this training program and generally I have run at quite a high heart rate which I'm able to maintain for a reasonable time.
Today, after running mostly in low zones with some interval work mixed in for the past 8 weeks, I decided to see where I was at and run a fast 5k. I ended up doing better than I thought, but out of a time of 22:42, 22:08 of it was in zone 5, and my HR got up to 206. I was under the impression that you aren't supposed to be able to maintain Z5 for more than a brief sprint so I'm just curious as to whether my results are normal or I should be doing something different in terms of HR zones? I definitely pushed harder than usual for this run than I have since the start of my HR training, but generally this is indicative of how I've run since I started running a few years ago and I have run faster before, albeit at a similarly high HR (without a HR strap though).

46,46,46,46,First marathon! Done Solo!,1602008485,"This past Saturday [I ran my first solo marathon](https://imgur.com/a/IPzaQZa). I am by no means a fast runner and am a solid Clydesdale but here is the breakdown:

1st Quarter: Miles 0-6.5 - 80mins

This was a breeze. My splits were right around the 11:55 to 12:15 mark. Mind was in full zen mode as most of my training runs had been in this length. As I was nearing the end of this segment, my body finally caught up with my mind and I had to stop to use the bathroom as all of my early morning attempts were thwarted. 

2nd Quarter: Miles 6.5-13.1 - 90 Mins

Gravel is starting to invade my shoes, more people are showing up on the trail with bikes and things are getting a bit warmer. My gallon of water I packed with me is starting to wear a little on my back so its time to start taking some water in. [I stopped to take a quick picture of a local black bear up on the side of the mountain.](https://imgur.com/vfoyckG) 

3rd Quarter 13.1-19.6 100 Mins

The heat of the day is starting to catch up with me and the amount of water I'm taking in means I may run out by the end. I stop to eat a protein bar in the shade as my carb loading from the night before seems to have warn off. At mile 16 my body was not having it but I pushed through after a quick stop and stretch and it was time to go again. 

4th Quarter 19.6-26.2 120 Mins

Alright Jeff, you can do this... ""I Know I can... I know I can"" repeats in my head often. My pace has slowed to that of a brisk walker but I make sure to keep in my running form. I'm down to my last liter and just imaging the taste of the two Gatorade mixes I have in the car. As I am coming down the back stretch, I always break the long run down into a percentage ie what percent of the run are you willing to allow yourself to walk at your normal pace. For me since this was my first marathon, I said 90% run would be acceptable. Well, I walked the first 1/4 miles and haven't since so I start doing the math. At mile 23.75 I could take a pass and walk the rest of it home and would be ""acceptable"". But Fudge that! Press on. Those ladies who are talking louder than sin, keep them at your rear and keep going. I hit the the 25th mile and my body says ""enough, walk her home...its been a long day"". So I slow down to an abysmal walking pace and can just *feel every step and joint creak*. No more gliding as the sun beats down on my face. As I reach the start line I pump my fists in the air and let out an internal scream of success. ""You did it!"" Then I promptly headed to the car, hugged it for still being there, and reclined and drank my juice, contemplating my first time. 

**Total time 390 Mins**

**Distance: 26.2 Miles**

**Average Split time: 14:52**

I’m re-training after a 5-months’ hiatus due to the lockdown in my country; I run a few HM in training but I prefer 10ks.

I always land on the side of my heel,  pronate and extend the foot, and push with the ball of my feet. With greater distances, I began to feel that this strike was suboptimal, because it was noisy, heavy on my knees (and, to a lesser extent, to my hips) and it caused me to lose a lot of momentum.

A more experienced (although on shorter distances) friend of mine told me he always runs on just the ball of his feet.

I tried that and I think that, while switching to his form is not easy, what he suggests is lighter on my joints and dissipates less momentum. It’s also way more silent and more efficient at faster paces. I’m not sure if that’s sustainable for runs longer than 1-2Kms though.

76,76,76,76,Any One Here Start Running After Ankle ORIF?,1601990371,"Kind of hoping for a success story to give me something to work towards/give me optimism. 

Last summer I had gotten into going for long hikes and starting to run, however in October I fractured my ankle in three places. This resulted in me having an open reduction and internal fixation surgery, where I had 10 screws, and a large plate inserted (one on the inside of ankle, and 9 + plate on the outside). After the surgery I was non-weight bearing for almost three months, with gradual increase to full weight bearing for another couple months. 

I asked my surgeon for physiotherapy, but he said due to my level of activity he did not feel it would benefit much. He said I could go ahead, if I wanted, but he felt gradual exercise would loosen up the tension far better than the physiotherapy would. I did about 2 months of physiotherapy in-office, anyways, but had to stop due to the pandemic shutting down non-essential services.

In July of this year I had a second surgery to remove the 9 outside screws and plate due to the screws protruding from the skin (yes, it was gross), and now find my range of motion is a lot better than before. It's still tight, but much better than it was.

After walking most of the summer with little issues, I decided it was time to try running again. I downloaded a couch to 5k app, and am currently on my third week. While I've been doing okay, I'm definitely slow and feel like I'm struggling a lot.

About 10 months ago, I started experiencing some pain in my right hip, and the ortho I went to said it was because of the Flex Deck treadmills my gym uses (I hardly run outside, except if I can't make it to the gym), and that they caused hip bursitis. She said it's because I was doing sprints where I was going 10-11mph for 30 to 45 seconds and because I was still new to running and was going too hard, too fast. Well, in that 10 months, I feel like I've conditioned myself better, to where I can easily hold 6mph for 10+ minutes and would consider myself a fast jogger/slow runner. However, this pain keeps reoccurring, and is now being couple with pain in my right knee. It goes away if I take a rest day, but comes back within two days of getting back to running.


I've tried stretching, not sure if there are specific exercises for this. I've tried different shoes, I did Brooks Ghost 12 first and loved them, then switched to the Adrenalines next, which after 6 months are now causing blisters in my arch, which is a whole other problem.

I'm new to to running sport, I just started before summer (let's say late May) with a 2 km in around 7 min/km, now I've reached a gol of 8 km in around 5 min/km (5 min and 2 sec my record, to be precise).

I've went through six doctors and none of their methods worked.  It never got to the point where it hurts to squat or walk, but it also never truly healed.

Symptoms:

I then educated myself on nutrition and started eating healthy. Also added full body strength exercises in my routine with cardio.I achieved a lot of stamina within next two months.

In the last two months, I decreased my calories intake to dangerously low ( I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was too much passionate to get in shape until today, my 18th Birthday).

So I finally achieved it. Not just physical fitness, But mentally too. if you were to see me who I was and who I am today, you wouldn't believe I was that guy.I never lose temper, I am always focused and full of energy. So this is how big the difference is.

I've tried daytime running with a KN95 mask a few times, but it became saturated after 4-5km, and I could only get enough air to walk home.

The problem is that the mask sticks flat to my face, shrinking the effective surface area to a tiny bubble around my nose.  I thought maybe it'd be useful to 3D print a support structure or something, but it turns out these already exist on eBay and similar sites, if you search for ""3d mask support"":

I tried one with a cross shape, but found the above design more comfortable.  So far, I've been able to run 7km in either one without keeling over, so they seem to work reasonably well.  They should be compatible with most types of mask, as long the mask is bigger than the bracket, and everything stays in place.

Speaking of keeping stuff in place, I also been use medical tape (1"" 3M Transpore) to attach the KN95 to my nose, so it doesn't leak and fog up my glasses.",running,p1mrx,False,/r/running/comments/j5xcov/increasing_my_running_masks_effective_surface_area/

When i started running i was surprised by how poor shape i was in, because when i had never ran before and i thought i would be a good runner if i tried. My confidence got slapped in the face when i tried to run a 3 000 meter with some friends, i ran/walked it in 20 minutes. 19 years old, tall and slim, had been lifting weights and considered myself in shape, not anymore.

Then during exam season a year later i found it was nice to go out running between reading, i was just gonna warm up with some laps around a football field. I ran 2 laps in a pace faster than what i've my pace usually was, without even getting tired and thought ""huh, i guess i gotta keep going and see what 3k time i can hit"", i just kept going i was in a flow state, things felt right and i was fast. I hit the 3k mark at 14:45. I was stoked, damn i had been doing minimal cardio and i used to think 15 minutes 3k at 12 km/h pace was where i wanted to be, but i ran it at 19 - 20 minutes. Now i just did it with ease, out of the blue. I thought ""sheesh imagine if i trained for like 6 months now, I bet i'd hit 12 minutes 3k by then, and thats FAST.""

Anyways, after that one run i've been running a lot more, only to have gone back to running my shitty times, now the best i can do is 18 minutes 3k at 6 min/km pace - 10 km/h. Whenever i jog now my pace seems to be 6 minutes/km for 3k distance, and it goes to 7 min:km when i go for distances 4k - 8k.

Wtf happened during my run when i just pulled out a 14:45 3k out of the blue, and havent gotten close since?? It's bothering me a lot, you don't just improve your 3k time with 3-4 minutes randomly one session, then never again be able to do it.

What could possibly cause this? Theres gotta be something wrong with me. When i was young i got told i had exercise induced asthma, i forgot about this and never went to check-ups anymore after 15-16. I've never been bothered much while running as long as i warm up slowly first. But i still thought asthma might be the reason i didnt run consistent 14:45s, so i went and got meds, took them strictly for 4 months at least, didnt improve anything so i stopped.

Honestly, anyone have any clue what could be the reason behind this nonsense with my times? It's bothering me a lot and i'm clueless",running,2kool4skool1337,False,/r/running/comments/j5xbje/hit_a_3k_pr_with_minimal_training_still_cant_beat/

150,150,150,51,How do you start running with your experienced S/O (long post but question in TL;DR),1601932317,"Hi there, I'm a 29 y/o woman with not the best track record with running. I'm not in bad shape, however I do not have the best of heart beat regulation capabilities. I go up in the 150s fast and have a hard time not feeling like I'm dying for air at that point. Maybe a year ago, my S/O said why don't you come run with me? I said sure! Why not right? (The very not runner me...) I than realised that running was a very tough sport. I bought real running shoes to help my poor poor feet, ankles and knees, a good sports bra because well running is bouncier than you'd think and tried my best. 

He however was in good shape, running a very easy 5min/km on a rough day. I quickly realised that I couldn't follow, but that was normal I guess, so what we did was going out for a run 4 times a week with one bike. I'd bike for 6 km and he'd bike at my pace (whatever it is, but way slower than 5min/km). That worked wonders for a few weeks. I'd feel good about my 2, he'd feel like he's had a normal workout and we'd encourage each other. That was GREAT!  


Now, covid-19 came along (I feel like it's a season of it's own) and with it, came confinement and working from home, and stressing and eating, and.. and.. and... I believe there are here a lot of people who kept going and never gave running up (I'm absolutely impressed by you by the way!), but I also believe we are not the only ones that threw all of it in a box and watched the world end while eating macaroni and cheese (our confinement go-to).

Fast-track to now, I've put on 10 pounds and S/O 20. So S/O tells me, that's not good, I miss the ""in shape"" me where I don't feel out of breath after teaching an online class (both teachers from home here). He was exaggerating but he'd put a lot of pressure on finding back that shape of his. And said we'd start running again but that the old bike/run thing we had going was ""getting old... I'm all out of shape we'd start from the same point anyway so let's just run together"". I said ok sure... thinking we'd be at the same point. HA! was I wrong! Last Saturday, we went for a run... We hit 1.5 km, I'm huffing and puffing, I have trouble slowing down my breath and I'm overall struggling. He has a little knee pain but he's overall O.K it seems. So after 2 km, I say ""I'd walk home and I can meet you there..."" He answers, ""Nah I stopped here to walk. We walk a km or so and then we run another 2 in the park when you're recovered"". In my head I'm screaming ""BEFORE confinement I was doing 2 km on a GOOD day!!!"" but I said, ok let's try your way, after all, maybe you need a little recovery walk too. So we walk and then run, and come home. I was pretty proud I survived it, 6.15min/km for 4 km total, that was a damn good outing in my stats. My knee hurt from previous injury and my compensating ankle hurt too  so I thought ok that's cool, but I might not do a 4 km outing 4 times a week, maybe 2 times and the rest of the outings I'd do 2 km... Just the time I get muscle back. 

Today we went out. I asked if we could do 2km today so we don't get hurt. He didn't really answer but we started running. As soon as we hit 1 km, my heart and lungs are ready to jump out of my body and by 1.5, he has to stop because i'm behind and he sees I'm dying. We walked a little and start back up again. He still doesn't say much but he does say ""you can do it!"". I'm in pain, I feel like he's is top shape so I tell him, I'd finish my 2 km and than walk home and ask him if he want's to keep going for another two. His answer: ""Yeah, I was going for a 4 km, but what a drag that you can't"" When he came home, he told me he was disappointed because the point of running together was to encourage each other but if I flake out midway it's not cool. 

I did tell him that running was incredibly difficult for me and I did loose my temper a little because for me it's really hurting that he is ""disappointed"" that I can't run at his pace. Or that it's sad that I can't run with him. How is it that he can't run slower? Or for a shorter distance, how is it that I have to ask him to run a step behind me so I don't feel like I'm chasing forest gump?

Anyway, all that to ask: Have you ever tried to introduce your S/O to running, how did it go? How do you encourage a beginner and how, as a beginner do you meet expectations or explain how to share them positively?

Wow, just re-read the whole thing, I think maybe I needed to get some stuff out in the open.

151,151,151,52,I ran my first race (a marathon ~ 4:05) in under a month and you can too.,1601932256,"Hey guys! 

I'm 24M 150 lbs

\*\*Background:\*\*

I got back into running after a six year break following the end of my soccer career. That may explain the progression, however I don't believe leg muscles/cardio is that easy to maintain as a climber/smoker. 

My first run was August 17th, my friend asked me to run a marathon with him in mid-September. The date of the race was October 3rd. I quit smoking five days before the race.

I finished in 4:05:23,about five minutes shy of my goal time. \*\*I made two major mistakes.\*\*

1. I forgot my gels in the car, hit a wall at 25 miles, right before the final 400ft+, 9%??+ hill (my legs were fine. I just should have eaten more.)
2. I outpaced myself in the first 6-8 miles by having way to much fun talking to other runners and Forgot to check my pace. Honestly it was worth it but stay on top of your pace.

Lesson learned. I'll run another next spring aiming even lower. I'll have time to devise a sub 3 in 6 months plan.

Heres the strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/4145854889](https://www.strava.com/activities/4145854889)

Every one of my runs this year is recorded.  I ran 89-95 miles in the space of a month and a half leading up to the race. Only about 40 are training FOR the race. I averaged about 16mi per week leading up to the race.

Here's the plan!

\*\*Week 1:\*\*

Run 10 miles at some point. Hard but not enough to kill you for too long.

\*\*Week 2:\*\*

Sunday - Run a personal half marathon (13.1 mi) at max effort this will help you determine your pacing and build confidence. 

Wednesday - Run a mid length (6-9 mi) run at max effort for leg strength and again, confidence. If you ever find yourself breaking this pace in the race, you're going to damn fast.

Friday - Run a slow long run (10-13 mi) at conversation pace. Most likely a minute slower than your half pace.

\*\*Week 3: Race week\*\* 

Sunday - Run a \*\*LONG\*\* run (15-18mi)- at conversation pace. This will help with confidence. 

Monday/Tuesday - run a short (2-4mi) max effort run

Wednesday/Thursday - Find a comfortable pace you can maintain for 6+miles that is at least 20 seconds slower than your half pace. 

Rest until race day. Remember your gels/snack bars. Try to get sleep before the race if you can (I couldn't). stay on top of your pace, and check the elevation map to make sure the sick fucks didn't put a hill at the 26th mile.

### Making up a Race

On Jan 1st, I signed up to run the Portland Marathon with a friend because I thought it would be fun to run a 26 mile race while I was 26. When the official race was cancelled because of covid, I decided it would be fun to make up my own race course through my city and run it on the same day the actual marathon would have happened, because at the end of the day my main goal was just to cover the distance (with a hopeful goal of a &lt;4 hr time). I'm lucky enough to have 3 friends crazy enough to be convinced that running a made up marathon with me would be a fun time :)

### Training
I ran cross-country (not particularly well) in high school and have run off and on since then, so 5k and 10k races feel pretty casual for me. Before starting this training plan, I had never run a race over 10k and my longest training run ever was 9 miles. 
I started my training with the [Hal Higdon Intermediate 10k Training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/10k-training/intermediate-10k/) to build up a base after a long (~1 yr) break from running. Then after finishing this I moved on to the [Hal Higdon Novice 2 Marathon plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/)

### Pre-race
Woke up at 4:30am, ate breakfast to give me time to digest, then went back to bed for a couple hours. Met my friends at the ""starting line"" at 7:30.

### Race
Going into the race, my strategy was to hold a steady 9min/mile pace for the whole race. I ended up getting excited and feeling especially good at the start, so went out faster then intended. I ended up feeling really good running mid to high 8s per mile, and hit mile 20 thinking it was possible to finish well under 4 hours. Then I hit mile 22, and my body started to fall apart. I guess this was the notorious wall. My legs felt like lead and just wouldn't corporate. Luckily I had built up enough of a bummer that I limped through the last 3ish miles  at over 10min/mile pace and still finished under 4!

### Post-race
We finished in a park, ate pizza, and drank gatorade. Overall I felt not terrible, but the race was definitely one of if not the most difficult physical experiences of my life. 
I would highly recommend making up and running a virtual race to anyone who feels depressed about their actual races being cancelled this year!

This is my second marathon, first “solo” (had some company most of the way), first marathon in September 2019 I ran 4.18 and I ran it just to finish. And if you were in the UK yesterday, you’ll know the conditions were brutal (thanks, storm Alex...)


I ran all my long training runs at 6min/km average except one where I had 19km out of 24km at ‘marathon pace’ that I over egged at 5.20/km and got dizzy. I spent the whole week leading up to the race preparing myself to fail my sub-4 attempt. And I would have done had it not been for my friend pacing me from 12km to 30km. I don’t know how to do proper race reports but for those who are interested, below is how my race played out...

I ran the first 12k 10s faster on average than I’d planned but it felt so easy that I figured I’d save up the seconds on my pace for later (probably the worst piece of marathon pacing advice ever, don’t do what I did). 

I picked up even more just before the half way point, then I started to feel it, which worried me a lot because in my last marathon I remember thinking how fresh I felt at 13 miles. But I managed to stick with the pace, running under 5.30/km for the majority. At 30k, I was 11 mins ahead of my goal and this made me feel great - I knew I could run 6/km for the rest and still make it. I was on a high then so felt like I’d already made it.

Until 37km when the wall hit...it was so late on I thought I’d be fine, but it was brutal. On top of this I think my garmin dropped out a bit as it kept saying I was running 7/km when I DEFINITELY wasn’t. Once it caught up, it turned out I was going 4.55/km to try and make it catch up...

But I made it. I’ve never been in more pain than I am today.

Racing a marathon is a very different experience to running a marathon. 
Trust in your taper
Pacers are angels

182,182,182,83,Modified training plan has me running greater distances than target half marathon,1601911756,"Long story short: I’m starting Week 4 on Higdon’s Intermediate 1 Half Marathon training plan. I’ve never ran a Half marathon distance before, with my longest run prior being 11 miles. 

I started Week 1 and felt it was way too easy in terms of mileage, so I bumped up the long run by 3 miles. So, instead of the prescribed 4 mile run in Week 1, I took a 7 mile run. 7 also felt not very challenging, so then I took a 10 miler on Week 2, and have chosen to progressively go up by 1 each time thereafter. 

Now in Week 3, I completed an 11 mile long run. In Week 5 of 12, I will go for what’s essentially a Half Marathon at 13 miles. 

Keeping the modification, my long runs will be consistently above Half Marathon distances (and as high as 17 miles) after Week 5. Is this to be avoided? I feel like I made a naive error in making this modification, and most training plans I’ve read only get slightly below the long run distance of the target race (at least for half and full marathons). 

So, basically what do you think I should do? I guess I could pivot to a full marathon plan, just keep going as I have been, bump up the other runs in terms of mileage, etc. After days of thinking with no strong feelings as to how to proceed, I felt like I should ask as this community has such knowledgeable runners!

I was running a lot more before; marathon training and everything but I decreased the last couple years due to both dental school taking all my time AND ITB injury coming back and forth. I was still running, of course but maybe 2-3 times a week, very low mileage. I was still running slow (2h) half marathon once in a while so my fitness was ok and i was cross training depending of the season (xc skiing a lot, yoga, etc)  


I've start running a bit more recently since ITB is getting a lot better. i'm not running that much tho because i'm starting slow to avoid injury: 5 days a week divided by two slow 3 miles, two 5miles and 1 longer trail run 6-10miles, maybe switching 1 run by interval training. i'm hoping i can increase during the next few months but very slowly to get back to marathon shape next spring.  rest days are pilates or weight training.

### Preamble 
*record scratch*  You might be wondering how I got myself into this situation.  I never planned on doing an ultra this year.  I’ve never even run a distance longer than a marathon until now. 
 
I had plans.  *plans*.  This was the year I’d rebuild from the disaster that was my Boston debut and the months of injury and burnout that followed.  In December I sat down with a pad of paper and sketched out my racing plan for the year...a few half marathons, a 5k, a couple of 10ks, PRing at every distance and culminating in the Chicago Marathon to cap off a huge comeback year. 
 
Then the pandemic hit.  One by one, my races fell off the board as they were all cancelled or went virtual.  Of the 9 races I had planned, I ended up running zero of them.  In the summer, I was feeling a bit directionless because the Chicago Marathon had been cancelled.  I figured I’d maybe run a half marathon time trial if everything else fell through, but then I got news that the Manitoba Marathon was planning on holding a race on the 11th, the same day as Chicago.  That worked great with my training plan!  So I started building up the mileage, getting my body into marathon running mode.  Then with 5 weeks to go till the race, it “went virtual”.  To hell with that.  If I’m going to wreck my body running another marathon, it’s got to be official, no way I’m doing.  At this point I’m slowly resigning myself to the idea that I might not get to race this year.   
 
But, as often happens, I had an epiphany while I was out running.  I remembered a short Facebook exchange I had with a friend, who knew somebody who was registered for this 100k but unable to run it so they were looking to get rid of their bib.  He had tagged me but at the time I was still training for my marathon and said, “it sounds like fun and I totally would buuuuuuttttttt”....except now I really had no excuses not to.  So what if this race broke me and I couldn’t race for months?  Not like there’s any races happening.  Not like I have anything else on my racing schedule to plan around.  I’m already fit enough to run a marathon.  I’ve entertained the idea of running an ultra in the past, even going so far as to claim that I was built to run ultras due to my tendency to be a slow twitch endurance monster, and to have the GI tract of a Greek god, with the ability to eat tons of trash food and suffer no ill effect while running.  So I finished my training run and sent my friend a Facebook message.  “So you know that bib that was available?” 
 
 
  
### Training 
For the vast majority of my running career, I’ve been a road runner.  I’ve followed Pfitz plans, read Jack Daniels, watched Tinman videos and incorporated those philisophies into my training.  With 4 weeks to prepare specifically for an ultramarathon with no trail running or ultra training experience I was definitely out of my comfort zone.  And as it turns out, the ultra world is still kind of fringe, with not a ton of training resources or science behind it.  Asking around for advice and researching online, there wasn’t a lot of definitive resources out there other than some advice on “back to back long runs” and “accumulating time on your feet”, so I had to wing it a little.  I know 4 weeks doesn’t leave much time for gainz but I think it was more mental prep than physical.  I needed to have a game plan, to test out some strategies, to gain a bit of confidence and shift mental gears from “race below lactate threshold and don’t bonk” to “keep moving in a forward direction for 12 hours and try not to collapse in a field  
Somewhere.” 

I can pretty much break my training for this race into three phases: “Base building” which incorporates the tapering and recovery from a 10 mile TT I did at the end of July; “Marathon training” which lasted about 4 weeks in August up to the point my marathon got cancelled, and “Ultra training” which represents the 4.5 weeks in September after I signed up for the ultra. 
 
“Base Building”:  Mileage between 40-60 mpw, running 7 days a week, mostly easy runs with maybe a few strides, long runs 12-14 miles at moderate intensity. 
 
“Marathon training”: Based loosely off Pfitz training plans but individualized.  Still running 7 days a week, breaking some of my midweek runs into doubles, doing some variation of a LT workout once a week (usually about 5 miles @LT in one or two intervals), and strides at least once a week.  Long runs in the 18-21 mile range at moderate intensity.  Mileage in the 65-70 mpw range. 
 
“Ultra training”:  My last 4 weeks mileage were 69, 58 (recovery week), 74, 61 (taper).  Still did a LT workout on Tuesdays.  Slightly increased intensity of my shorter midweek runs for the purpose of maintaining speed and power, but drastically decreased the effort on long runs to simulate the pacing of an ultra and to emphasize more time on my feet.  Did a 26.2 mile long run on the 28th mostly as a confidence builder.  Tired and a bit sore, but I held up pretty well.  It’s remarkable how different a long run feels at a lower pace compared to my marathon style long runs where I’m pushing the effort to the edge of what’s comfortable.  I continued my trend this year of running 7 days a week, and specific to this phase I tried to include a moderately long run following my weekly “long run”.   
 
So overall, it maybe wasn’t an ideal ultramarathon training block, although at this point I’m still not sure what an ideal training plan would even look like. 

Oh yeah, did I mention we just had our second child in June?  Finding that balance between domestic responsibilities, work, and training was difficult at times, and I am very grateful that I have a very patient wife who puts up with me while I spend seemingly all of my spare time either running, or chatting about running, or monitoring my running stats. 
  
### Pre-Race 
My pre-race started the day before, as I had to wake up and drive the 8 hours to St. Paul on Friday.  The drive was pretty uneventful, and after checking into my motel and picking up my race package, I met up with my friend Mac who recommended the race to me, along with a group of other racers and we had dinner at a local restaurant (Pulled pork mac and cheese and a pint of beer).  Then I went for a quick 5k shakeout run, went back to my motel and showered and started assembling my race kit. 

I painstakingly loaded up my vest with all kinds of goodies and fluids (1.5L camelbac, 2x500mL bottles filled with Gatorade, 4 baggies filled with oreos, sesame sticks, peanut butter stuffed pretzels, corn chips, 8 Gu gels, and 2 slices of pizza).  After some careful consideration, I decided to ditch the 1.5L water pack to save weight, banking on being able to refill my water bottles at the transition stations placed roughly every 20k on the course.  I estimate maybe 3000 calories worth of food and Gatorade, plus a few more Gu gels and some more snacks stuffed in my drop bag which would be available at roughly 60k.  I’m pretty new to the concept of eating during a race and wasn’t really sure how many calories I should be eating, but my gut has always been cooperative so I figured I should aim to replace roughly half of the calories I burn while running.  I also packed a light jacket (would be cold in the early morning), gloves, a hat, a headlamp, my phone, and my ear buds.  Crazy how much stuff you can cram in those running vests. 
 
The rest of the evening I spent just chilling in my motel, writing up the pre-race portions of this report, and called it a night around 11.  
 
Morning of the race was pretty uneventful.  After a night of anxiety dreams including forgetting my timing chip, showing up to the start line an hour late, and having to speed through busy streets back to my hotel to grab all the things I forgot, I woke up with plenty of time to spare, grabbed all of the things I forgot in my dream, ate a cold slice of pizza, a packet of Honey Stinger gels, a box of coconut water and a can of cold brew coffee for breakfast, and headed to the start line.  It was a socially distanced start line so you kind of just showed up at around the designated time for your wave and started whenever.  I met up with Mac and the other members of his running club, took a quick pre-race photo, and then was like, “well let’s get this over with” and headed out. 
 
In terms of race strategy, I really wasn’t sure what to expect.  Having never run anywhere close to 100km before I wasn’t really sure what kind of pace or effort I should be aiming for.  In training runs the slowest pace I could run at before my stride got all shuffly and inefficient was about 9:00/mile, so I calculated that if I could maintain that pace for most of the day, allowing for a few short walking and rest breaks, a 10 hour finishing time would be a pretty good A goal.  That being said I was told the course record was around 10 hours so maybe the course difficulty would eat up some extra time as well.  I guess the only way to find out was to run it, right?  Just keep moving forward and keep the pace relaxed.  The main thing I wanted to avoid were the crippling muscle cramps I suffered in Boston last year that left my feet pretty much glued to the ground for minutes at a time. 
  
### Race 
 
**Leg 1** 
 The race started by running on a multiuse path on the outskirts of town.  With the sun just starting to rise, a little bit of frost and fog rising from the ground, it made for a very picturesque start to the race, and was the first of many moments in the day where I was struck by the beauty of the landscape.  After a couple flat and uneventful miles, I did something else for the first time that would repeat itself throughout the day – missed one of the little pink flags marking the first turn of the race and ran a couple hundred feet in the wrong direction before one of the other runners called me and another guy back to the course.   Oops.

We ran through a couple residential streets, some people on lawn chairs drinking their morning coffee and cheering us on – something I really missed from races in the before times.  Along a boardwalk next to a lake with hundreds of Canada geese honking their support.  Across the highway and onto some more soft gravel recreational trails winding their way across some bogs and light forests.  The first 9 miles of the course were pretty flat, and I maintained a very consistent 8:40/mile pace and was feeling really good.  And just when I was thinking that this race was pretty simple and straightforward – the flags suddenly veered off to the left and up a 100 foot embankment.  I guess those first 9 miles were just a warm up.  The next 4 miles varied between a single track dirt path along the edge of farmland, then into forest with loose leaves, deadfall, and muddy bogs to dance around.  Lots of the trail wasn’t even runnable because of having to duck under or jump over branches, or scramble up a steep ridge.  It was here that I logged my first 14+ minute mile, and started to think that 10 hours may have been an overly ambitious goal.  

The first checkpoint was around the 13 mile mark, and I came in feeling pretty good.  It had warmed up to the point where I could take my jacket, hat and gloves off and stash them.  I didn’t waste too much time at this checkpoint, just refilled my water bottles, took a Gu, chugged a bottle of Powerade, and left with a wave and a smile off to the second leg of the course.

**Distance** : 13.5 miles

**Time:** 2:31:50

**Leg 2**

This leg of the course started with a few hilly ups and downs winding across a ridge, before crossing a barb wire fence into a farmer’s field.  This was also where following the course got a bit dicey.  Many of the flags had fallen over so they were a bit difficult to see on the ground, and there were a couple diverging paths where it wasn’t obvious which direction you should go, so I had to stop and search around for a flag indicating the correct path.  On a couple instances where another runner was with me, we would head off in either direction and shout when we saw the next flag to call the other runners back onto the course.  Yay teamwork!  The track we were running on was pretty rutted from having been plowed, so I had to alternate between watching the ground where I was stepping so I didn’t roll my ankle in a rut, but also keep an eye out for flags.  I ran off course an additional two times, luckily a fellow runner called me back.  I was also guilty of pulling out my phone on occasion and taking pictures or texting updates to friends, and when I missed a turn because I was texting and running and had to get called back on course, I sheepishly put my phone away for a while.  I did make up for it later by calling back another runner who was headed off in the wrong direction, and I started yelling out every time I saw a flag, so I feel like I balanced my karma.

After a few miles of chaotic rambling through fields, averaging 10-11 minutes per mile, the course spat us onto a gravel road for about 6 miles.  I found I was pretty easily able to settle back to a fairly comfortable 9 minute/mile pace, which was pretty reassuring at this stage.  It was during this stretch that I hit the four hour mark, which was a milestone in the sense that it was now the longest duration run that I’ve ever done.  At about 25.5 miles or about 4:13, I hit the second checkpoint, which was good timing because by this time the sun was out in full, it was starting to get warm, and I was out of water and feeling pretty thirsty.  Physically still feeling pretty good at this point though.  I took a few minutes to rest and refill my bottles, drank another bottle of Powerade and a bottle of water, ate a bag of chips, and chatted with a few of the support crew.  They warned me that the third leg was the toughest and longest of the day.  Well, let’s get it over with then.

**Distance** : 25.5 miles

**Time:** 4:13:48

**Leg 3**

Leg 3 started easily enough, winding through some packed dirt forest trails for a mile or two before exiting onto a road at the top of a stunning panoramic view at the top of a giant hill, with an even taller ridge ahead in the distance.  Guess where we were headed?  After coasting downhill and dropping about 300 feet of elevation, there was a very excitable dude at the bottom of a hill who gave us a nice little pep talk, something along the lines of “THIS is what you came here for, now GO AND GET HER!”  Whoo!  So I was feeling pretty hyped until I actually got to the base of the 600 foot high ridge that we had to climb.  It was pretty fun though.  We had to vault over a fence into a pasture complete with grazing cows who were gracious enough to let us pass by.  Then it was uphill, downhill, uphill, downhill, and finally scrambling up a super steep hill to finally get to the top of the ridge.  I quickly decided I was not even going to attempt running up these hills, so took the opportunity to eat a slice of pizza and some Oreos and Gu while I walked.  Even so, I was puffing pretty hard and my glutes were on fire by the time I got to the top.  5 and a half hours and 32 miles in at this point, but surprisingly still feeling not too bad.  

There was a nice interlude where I coasted downhill on a gravel road for a mile or two and cut across another field before stopping at a water station along the shore of a lake.  Quickly refilled my bottles, and then slowly wound our way up another ridge alongside the lake, over ground covered with ankle high grass and little saplings.  Then it was back onto road/flat trail for another 5 miles until we hit the third aid station.  By this point I was about 7 hours or 42 miles in.  Things were starting to feel pretty sore and crampy, and I didn’t really have the power to push uphill very effectively so I was walking most of the uphills and would stop and walk for about 30 seconds every mile or when the burning in my muscles got to be too much.

The end of leg 3 was where I was able to access my drop bag, but I really didn’t need much out of it.  I didn’t feel like drinking the beer or cold brew coffee I had stached, I didn’t have any major chafe or blisters, and my hip flexors would cramp every time I bent forward so I really didn’t want to try changing my socks which were relatively dry and comfortable anyways.  A few of the support crew, noticing that I didn’t have a crew of my own, offered me some salt tablets which I graciously accepted, somebody gave me a wet towel for my face, and I drank a whole bunch of water and Powerade and just sat for a few minutes before heading on my way.  Less than a marathon to go.

**Distance** : 41.8 miles

**Time:** 7:17:35

**Leg 4**

Foreward progress.  After sitting for a while it was tough to get moving again, but I took off at a walk and after a few minutes I was able to run, although my pace had slowed into the 10 minute/mile range and I was taking more walking breaks.  I noticed there was a sign with two arrows facing in two different directions but rather than actually read the sign I just followed the guy who was a couple hundred feet in front of me and turned off to the left.  After a minute or two I caught up with him but I had this nagging feeling that something wasn’t right, so I asked him if whether he was a hundred mile or hundred km runner, and he told me he was a miler, and the 100k course was back the other way.  When it was all said and done I had run about a quarter mile in the wrong direction and had to double back, adding an extra half mile to my day.  Whoops.  So much for forward progress.  At least at this point I was too tired to even be mad, so I just shrugged and continued on my way.

The next few miles went from flat sandy ATV trail, to rolling gravel hills.  I alternated walking and running but continued to move forward.  I passed the lead female runner and her pacer at this point, and that was the last human I saw for the rest of this leg.  After a few more miles of rolling hills, I entered The Bog.  This is where people warned me I might get wet, and they actually had to reroute this part of the course because a beaver dam had flooded out the original course.  It was absolutely brutal terrain, the most I could do was stumble walk through knee high tangles of grass and branches, tightrope walking across dry sections of muddy bog.  It took about 17 minutes to cover a mile of terrain, but on the plus side I managed to keep my feet dry.  Then it was across some fallow field, into a forest path (I saw an elk), then onto another farmer’s field (walking by some nice horses who were probably wondering what the heck I was doing in their field), and finally up a hill to the final rest stop of the day.  I also hit another milestone, the double marathon 52.4 mile mark at about 9:23.

I was feeling in pretty rough shape by the time I hit the pit stop.  Pretty much everything hurt, but nothing hurt badly.  I was tired, hungry, thirsty, and a bit cranky.  Definitely ready to be done.  They had some decent food at this stop, and they asked me if I wanted Powerade, soup, chips, a sandwich, or a banana and I was like, “yes, all of it”.  Proceeded to sit down and down everything in the span of a couple minutes, except for the banana which I stashed in my vest for later.  One thing I learned from this race, which I had already suspected, but my stomach is definitely fit for ultramarathons.  It took everything I crammed in it like a champ.  I took a slightly extended break.  But when I started to shiver despite having just eaten soup and still sitting in the sunlight, I figured I’d better get up and move before my body decided it was done for the day and started to shut down.  While I was sitting there recovering, the leading female came through and left in like a minute.  My watch said 53.4 miles but I wasn’t sure how much distance I had added from all my off-course misadventures throughout the day but the volunteers told me I had about 20k, or 13 miles to go.  Okay, less than a half marathon.  I was pretty confident at this point that I would finish the race one way or another.  I told them even if I had to walk it in, I was going to finish.  Then I headed off for the final leg of the day.

**Distance** : 51.3 miles

**Time:** 9:40:53

**Leg 5**

This leg started with some rolling gravel road.  I appreciated that because I had no more desire or strength in my legs to handle much more technical terrain.  After about a mile, I overtook the lead female again, she appeared to be walking about 75% of the time, meanwhile I was still running (albeit much more slowly) about 90% of the time, trying to only walk the uphill sections.  After about 2 miles, the road flattened out and my legs started to feel a little bit better.  I tried to do a bit of race math and figured if I could maintain my 11 mile pace for the rest of the race I might still be able to get under 12 hours…but then the course veered off into the forest again.  By this point I was talking out loud to myself, and I just chuckled and said something like, “Of course you guys couldn’t make it easy for me, could you?”  The trail would have been runnable at least most of the way if my legs had been fresher, but my stabilizers were shot by this point and I just wanted to avoid rolling my ankle or falling over so I kept it to a power walk/slow shuffle on the flattest parts.  At one point a big tree trunk was in the way and I had to climb over it, and while I did my calf seized up and I had to drop my feet to the ground to release the spasm.  “Ok, so that’s how it’s going to be then?”.  Thankfully the forest section wasn’t too long, only a mile or two of steadily ascending trail that ended at another barbed wire fence.  It was at this point that I lost the trail once again, and while it seemed that I should head off in this direction, I couldn’t find any flags and was too tired to waste any more of my energy going in the wrong direction.  So I stopped, doubled back a little bit, looking around.  Another runner (a guy this time) caught up to me and we deliberated before deciding to head in the most obvious direction while I prayed out loud to please see a flag soon.  Thankfully we did and we both gave a little cheer.  One more barbed wire fence to crawl through, and while the guy was holding the fence apart for me to step through, my calf and then my hamstring both cramped at the same time.  I did an awkward little dance trying to unclench my muscles while he looked at me with some concern, offered me an Advil which I declined, figuring there’s no point this late in the race to bother.  I told him to go on ahead and he did, with me following behind a little bit slower.

60 miles and 11 hours in.  I thought I could see the lake from the start of the race at the bottom of this long, straight, slightly downhill sloping stretch of road.  The end was in sight.  The sun was setting and it was cooling down, which was nice because I was almost out of water.  I decided to finish off what I had with me, no point saving it if I’m already cramping up, and started my slow, painful homeward journey.

Despite being so far into the race, I found on flat solid road I could still manage about a 10 minute mile pace, with the occasional 30 second walking break.  That was good.  I hit the 100km mark at about 11:38, right before my watch died.  That was also good, for Strava stat purposes.  Unfortunately I was probably 4 miles from the finish.  My phone died shortly thereafter, and with the sun dipping below the horizon I was literally and figuratively in the dark.  I dug out my headlamp mostly so I wouldn’t miss any flags in the final miles of the race.  Passed a group of spectators having a bonfire and beers, who gave a little cheer and wished me good luck, to which I cheerfully waved and thanked them, but in my cranky head was like “yeah whatever”.  On and on, for what felt like an eternity.  Time ceased to have meaning.  I experienced a new level of fatigue, beyond the cardiovascular, beyond the tired muscles, this was a mental fatigue, that level of doneness where you’re like, “I just don’t want to do this anymore”.  But the only way to end this was to finish the race.  So just keep moving forward.

Eons later, I arrived in town.  I was so tired that I had no sense of direction, so I was still frantically searching for those marker flags to tell me which way to go.  Thankfully with each flag I passed, another reflective beacon of light and hope shimmered in the distance, lighting my way.  Finally, finally…I could hear cheering in the distance, and I saw the big lights that signaled the end.  Knowing I was at the end I got a burst of energy that powered me through to the finish, and I gave a tired little cheer as I crossed the finish line, in 12 hours, 18 minutes, 30 seconds, good enough for 5th place overall.

**Distance** : 66.3 miles

**Time:** 12:18:30

### Post-race 

I wasn’t sure how I would handle crossing the finish line.  After all the cancelled races, changed plans, uncertainty, and at the end of a truly unprecedented run into totally uncharted territory, I wasn’t sure if I would break down crying.  As it turns out, mostly what I felt was relief.  I think my first words after crossing the finish line were, “Am I ever glad to see you guys….and holy crap was that ever hard.” 

I spent a few minutes sitting around a bonfire they had at the finish line,  ate some chips, chugged some more Powerade, and took off my shoes.  That’s when I realized half of my left foot was numb and swollen and I couldn’t dorsiflex my ankle, probably tendonitis from my shoe being laced too tightly.  Oops.  When I started violently shivering despite sitting 5 feet away from the fire, I figured I’d better start making my way back to the motel.  I shambled slowly to my truck, cursing having parked so far away.  When I got to my truck, I cranked the heat and then proceeded to chow down on the cookies, sesame snaps, honey stingers, and coconut water I had in my truck, then started sending out some text messages to let people know I was finished, and alive and well.  Then it was back to the hotel for a shower and bath fighting hip flexor, hamstring, calf, and toe cramps, and eventually passing out in bed.

Overall, I was very happy with my performance.  I didn’t achieve any of my time goals, but I think that was more due to my naivety than underperforming.  Not knowing the course at all, and having no idea how I would perform after 4 hours left a lot of unknowns.  And 5th overall is a pretty damn good performance for a converted road runner, running crewless on 4 weeks’ notice.  Will I do it again?  Probably, eventually.  But not any time soon.

What’s next?  I need to rest.  I am sore in places I didn’t know you could be sore from running.  I have an angry tendonitis in my foot that will need some TLC.  And I have nothing else planned in the next 6 months.  This is the perfect time for a reset, heal up properly, recharge from year of hard training and the mental exhaustion of trying to race during a pandemic, and spend more time at home with my family.  I’d also like to get into the gym and put on a bit of muscle this winter, and step away from running just enough so that I start to crave it again.

### Training
I’ve been running consistently since the start of the year, with a half-marathon training run a month or so ago, and plenty of 14-16k runs. Doing a 18k trail run last weekend probably wasn’t wise, but it was a beautiful lake path was at a casual pace. I run 3 times a week, and have been doing ever longer cycle rides with friends on gravel bikes. 

### Pre-race
Forecast was for A LOT of rain overnight, and it was teeming down during the early morning drive to the venue. Hadn’t been able to do much in the way of preparation the day before regarding diet, so fish and chips had to suffice, breakfast at 6am was granola as per usual. Took a flask of coffee along with towel and change of clothes in case the weather didn’t break. 

The COVID- safe distancing meant it was 10 runners at a time in pre-arranged time slots, like a Formula 1 grid, with those doing the full Marathon distance starting from 8am, and the Half Marathon runners an hour later - temperature gun testing as you walked in, and 5 mins later my wave was off.

### Race
This was my 6th Half Marathon, the most recent being a pancake flat East London one last year (01:45). I felt fitter and better prepared, but with a major difference; this was very hilly, up and down for most of the way (see Strava for profile). So I was aiming to do a steady 10k, then push on, in total contrast to the previous 5 I’ve run which were basically run 10 miles and hang on grimly for the finish or death, whichever came sooner.

The first 5k or so was a loop around the roads close to the start, and had some tough hills which you got to repeat twice. Once that was done we were onto a section of the North Downs Way, a long distance trail that follows a pilgrim path from one cathedral city to another in southern England. This was great fun, splashing through the puddles (though mercifully the rain was now just drizzle, and the temperature around 11 degrees, pretty much ideal).

Checking my time at the 10k mark and happy to see I’d stayed steady for the first (and hilly) half of the race, I felt I could kick on as it was all road now, and long stretches at that, with few turns. I started steadily overtaking people (some of whom were almost certainly marathon runners doing the course twice!) and didn’t start feeling heavy-legged until well after we reached the 10 mile mark. 

The last 2 miles were tough, and a flooded road followed by the steepest hill yet were testing, but the finish is after a long straight stretch that starts from the top of a hill, so the end is literally in sight. Finished in 01:48:40 and ran right through and round the car park for a good couple of minutes to ensure Strava registered the full half-marathon distance!

### Post-race
Tried walking and stretching straight away, but had to drink that coffee and some water, and get changed. Then walked some more and stretched fully but legs were really sore. The hour or so drive home was a constant fight to keep cramp at bay, and the sofa beckoned, but today it’s just the usual post-long run tiredness, so I count that as an added bonus. Strava gives you a grade-adjusted pace, which is useful ; actual pace 5:10/km, grade adjusted pace 4:45/km

190,190,190,91,Did I start off too fast without easing into my progress?,1601908029,"Hello all, 

I recently began running about two months ago. I've always been a fairly athletic guy, so I was able to start running 5km immediately. For the first two weeks of my running, I was running primarily on flat surface and I was feeling great. However, my living situation changed and I began trail running in a local park. The 5km loop in this park consists of 3km uphill, followed by 2km downhill. When I started running this loop, I noticed shin splints started to occur with increasing intensity and frequency. That being said, I was still able to push out a 5k usually 3-4 times a week. 

Last weekend, I returned to running flat surface and was able to put out an easy 8km, followed by a rest day, and the following day I ran my first 10km. It felt pretty well, however the following few days I noticed a pain in my left knee (perhaps I'm hyperextending it?) and my shin splints began to hurt again. Several days later I attempted another easy 5km and could only push out 3.5km because my knee kept hurting. Since then, I've decided to take a few more days off and work on my stretching and take it more seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, did I start off too fast and not ease into things? Am I clearly not taking off enough time between runs? Should I be warming up and stretching more? Should I wear different shoes for running? (for reference, I wear Salomon X Ultra 3 trail runners). Should I stick to flat, pavement running? I prefer to trail run. I'm to the point now where I'd like to run a 10km at least a few times a week, but I don't want to injure my body in the process.

I was training for a half for the last several months, slowly building my endurance. I have a virtual race that I have signed up for that needs to be completed by Oct 11th. For background, I can run 10k comfortably and I consider it enjoyable ( I am no speedster though).

Here's where I am standing with my training and also where I feel I went wrong.

Thanks (but no thanks) to COVID, I stopped going to the gym starting in March and resorted to only running.

In the past month, I have completed two 15 k (**this felt extremely challenging to me**) and a couple of 5-10 k on flat roads.

Eventually, the social isolation got to me and I ended up joining a running group (while socially distancing) and an outdoor boot camp type class in the past 2 weeks and I lost focus from my training plan.

I have not done a road run longer than 6 k in the past 2 weeks, however, I did complete a very technical 10 k trail run (**again felt extremely challenging, worse than the 15k**).

I was hoping to have completed at least an 18k before attempting the half. 

I have tried to increase my runs this week and I feeling that I have lost my endurance.

Completed a 3k on Friday. 5k yesterday and plan on a 7k tonight.

I feel like I let my training plan fail and I am not sure if I should attempt it all.

* There's a mild discomfort but nothing serious. I'm able to easily climb up and downstairs.
* The pain goes away when I'm running. The pain is comparatively more during my rest days.
* It doesn't feel like a muscle-related pain. Feels more like something related to veins. I'm not sure If I'm making sense here.

214,214,214,15,The FAQ section has a fairly anti-barefoot running take. Should it be a bit more neutral?,1601894257,"Hi all,

I was exploring the FAQ section today and noticed the anti-barefoot section in the FAQ has a fairly anti-barefoot bias.

Specifically

&gt;However the science behind the benefits are still heavily debated - like  much of the research into running shoes the studies are often small and  with little funding.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;A well publicised study on the Vibrams showed injuries from transitiong to the minimalist shoes  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Vibrams has since been subject to a lawsuit regarding claims it made about the benefits of it's shoes

Should this section be updated to be less biased? For example, maybe link to a small handful (or even just one - of course I'm not asking anyone to perform their own full-on literature review) study, and allow the reader to explore themselves further. Of course, while also keeping the existing words of caution.

As the section currently is, I imagine that someone who has never come across the topic before would be more convinced than otherwise not to look into it any further, whereas based on their own circumstances, they may have something to gain by investigating and/or experimenting themselves.

The specific lawsuit should also mention the case that was at play, and what the class action lawsuit was about -  specifically, ""advertising that the footwear could  reduce foot injuries and strengthen foot muscles, without basing those  assertions on any scientific merit"". There is a distinction here that studies had not been done on this previously, and therefore there was not sufficient scientific proof for them to make that claim. I also don't know the specific of this decision, as a brief look shows that studies showing some of these benefits did exist before this class action lawsuit. I'm not sure if the verdict was a result of those studies not being large enough, or that it was proven they hadn't tried to find any studies backing their claims, etc.

\---

Disclaimer: the section below will highlight some of my own biases, so please do your own research as I don't claim to have reviewed all available literature on the topic and able to offer any knowledge here, as I am but a sample size of 1 when it comes to my own running journey.

First of all, to address the Vibram case and their claims - there have since been studies showing that using your foot more (in minimal-type shoes) does in fact result in strengthening it, for example:  
[https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/8/e008307](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/8/e008307)  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/)

I am not aware of any studies showing that using minimal footwear will result in a decrease in foot strength, but should any be pointed out to me I will happily add them to this initial post as to present too much of a one-sided argument.

In regards to the sample size issue, I would flip that around and *also* pose the (open-ended) question - the minimal running shoe industry/movement/etc. is a miniscule one compared to what are currently (for the past couple decades) considered normal shoes. We have seen large companies in the past (e.g. Nike with their Nike free line, etc.) dabble in the 'minimal' shoe space. If they did believe in their own more maximal (using the term loosely as the opposite of minimal here) products, would they not instead have spent but a trivial, trivial % of their profits on studies to show that maximal shoes are good for you/your health/minimising injuries, and barefoot-type shoes were bad, thereby killing off that market completely? With their size and money, this should only have been far too easy to do.

If you're wondering why I bothered typing this up, it's because I was previously a maximal shoe runner who converted to minimal shoe (a mix of no cushion/drop shoes, with the occasional barefoot run) after never being able to run more than 20 miles a week without running into all sorts of niggles and issues. After making the switch, it's been 2 years and counting with no issues since and been able to steadily increase mileage at the same time.

I'm no maximalist/evangelist - I'm not here to convince anyone here who is happily and healthily running in whatever gear they have now to change, and if anything, they shouldn't. I totally believe the old adage if it ain't broke don't fix it especially when it comes to our own bodies. But I do think those with something to fix shouldn't be led away from exploring things that *may* work for them.",running,nymerhia,False,/r/running/comments/j5h3c8/the_faq_section_has_a_fairly_antibarefoot_running/
215,215,215,16,Just started running for 2 weeks now (3k then 5k). Is big progress in first and last km but barely in between normal?,1601894155,"30yo dude here who started running 2 weeks ago. 5'10""/177cm and 180 lbs/80kg, lifted weights 3 times a week for about 5 years prior to this one but have done just about no cardio in my life.

First and last time I ran (properly) was joining a 5K in 2018, was filling in a sick friend on short notice. Average pace was 7:49/km with no prior training, which I found impressive as a couch potato who only lifts for the aesthetics.

I started taking running seriously now and have been running 3-4 times a week now. I try to follow c25k but have trouble with timing the intervals so have been winging it. My pace so far:

* Week 1 (3k per run): Average 8:20/km
* Week 2 (5k per run): Average 7:30/km
* Week 3 (This week, 5k per run): Average 7:00/km

I've also been recording times for each km and the biggest improvement is the first km (went from 7:30/km to 5:30/km), then last km (went from 8:20/km to 7:00/km).

However the middle 3 km has been stagnant, around 7:30-8:00/km, meaning most of gains in average pace was due to the first and last km. Is this normal?

How do I improve it in general?

I fell in love with running as a fairly competitive cross country runner in high school, but I stopped running for the first semester of my first year of college. Second semester, I got back into it, but my runs were fairly short. I didn’t really run more than 5 miles on most runs. But when I was sent home in the middle of my second semester, with nothing worthwhile to do, I decided to start running seriously again. 

I steadily upped my mileage and found myself running faster and faster. My endurance pace during high school cross country was about 7:30-7:45. In the spring and summer, I was running in the low 7s. Now, I’m running 60+ miles a week at 6:50 or below, and it’s truly the one thing in my life that I’m proud of myself for right now. Today, I ran 12 miles at a 6:44 pace with super even splits. 

I’ve always been an overachiever in school, but I’ve also always been hyper-critical if myself. I (problematically) associate my self-worth with external judgements about me, like grades or positive feedback from professors. This remote semester, for some reason, has led me to fall victim to low self-esteem. But running makes me feel accomplished. It makes me feel like I’m truly good at something. It even, at times, makes me feel a slight air of superiority over other people. Maybe that’s bad.

So I made it to a nearby park with lots of shade and trees, and just started running laps. Among the trees, the tears felt more manageable. At least the sobs let to breaths of fresh air.

After a while, I just sat down on the most secluded bench I could find. I stayed there for nearly an hour. And then I got up and ran home, and suddenly everything didn’t feel quite so awful. Still pretty bad, but...maybe manageable.

234,234,234,35,Requesting feedback about my season plan,1601871139,"Hey!

I'm 17M, currently running having an offseason after a weird (COVID) triathlon season running around 35mpw. This season I ran a 36:54 10K (although the GPS seemed to record it only as 9,7km) which is my PB, my running peaked at 43mpw this May + \~7hrs on the bike trainer.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to use the Daniels 10K 50miles plan (18 weeks) and the Pfitz 90K base plan (\~10 weeks). I'll kick off the season around the 19th October and want to have my main race mid-april 2021 (10K).

If I followed the above mentioned plan, then I'd finish the 10 weeks of base plan around January and the Daniels around mid-April (which is perfect). My only concern that I'd like to have more races until mid/end-May. Should I repeat parts of Phase IV after a recovery?

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-October: Start of base training

&amp;#x200B;

January: Start of Daniels' 5-10K plan

&amp;#x200B;

Late-March/Early-April: 5-10K tune up races

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-April: 10K goal race

&amp;#x200B;

Until mid-May: some other 5-10K races

&amp;#x200B;

My mileage would start at 38 miles (61km) and would increase to \~60 miles (97km) in 10-12 weeks. Then I'd take probably one easier week and start Phase II with a single rest day and on 50mpw (80km) which wouldn't move much during the whole season. (I got the advice that short 3-4 week cycles aren't really a thing in running so I should keep them steady during the whole season. But honestly it'd make sense to vary my mileage during phases, like running lower milegage in Phase IV than in Phase II). So I'd run constantly around 50mpw (80km) until mid-May where I'd start base training for the fall season but that's for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-October - January: 38 to 60 mpw (10 weeks)

&amp;#x200B;

January - Mid-April: constant 50mpw (until goal race w/ 2-3 tune up races)

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-April - Mid-May: constant 50mpw (some other races)

Given that I'm scared shitless of getting COVID, I decided to run with a mask - after some online research and an article from a runner saying positive things about it, I decided to go ahead and buy one. Yesterday was my first run with it - my usual 13mi Saturday run. Here are my thoughts.

On the plus side, the materials are nice; the mask never felt hot or interfered with my breathing. Thumbs up on that. Plus it looks pretty bad ass.

Now what I didn't like. First of all, the ear loops are basically a thin piece of fabric; I'm not sure they will last long. My major complain, though, is the fit. I measured and double measured following the instructions on their site; asked my wife to measure me too, same results, and I purchased the recommended size.

Here is the thing - you measure from your ear to the bridge of your nose. However, the mask does not stretch; because the way it's shaped, the distance between the bridge of your nose and your chin is critical for a good fit. As usual with people of Italian descent (bring those stereotypes on!), I have a big nose, so although the mask has a nice horizontal fit, it wasn't long enough vertically to stay put - I had to adjust it many times during my run, to the point I'm giving up on it.

So... If you are thinking about buying this particular mask, be aware that the distance between your nose and your chin plays an important role when it comes to proper fitting.

I, along with nearly every other runner out there, do not negatively judge you when we see you out there trying. I have a tremendous amount of respect for you for trying to improve yourself, and I have nothing but positive encouragement for you. Even if your gasping for air, drenched in sweat and barely moving at a jog, I ask you not fear being judged, because all of us longtime runners know how brutal and difficult running can be, and the fact that you’re out there trying is commendable. It will suck, there is no avoiding it, but the feeling of accomplishment can not be rivaled by anything else. Indeed, many of us were in your shoes once, and having overcome these challenges ourselves, we realise how difficult, yet rewarding this experiences can be. When I see someone like this, I have to fight the urge not to stop them and tell them how awesome they are for giving it such a good effort. So, get up, go out and give it your best shot, because we are rooting for you and want nothing more than for you to succeed. If anything, I would think less of someone who refuses to try or gives up. I would NEVER judge or criticise someone who is trying.

I know I’m not the first to post something like this, but there is so much negativity in the world right now, and I figured you can’t have too much positive encouragement.

My thighs touch a little bit now, are always ""bloated"" - I feel like I look like Mewtwo (lol). I try not to restrict myself too much in how much I eat, just how healthy those foods are (I rarely eat out) (since I'm a medical student, it's hard to study when you're hungry). 

I'm becoming quite insecure about my legs. If my priority is to keep them slender, should I lower my km/week? Am I building muscle or gaining fat from eating more since I'm using more energy on my runs as I increase kms?

The pain occurs when I load up (leg steps down) and release (leg lifts).  There is no pain while under load.

I’ve taken the last 4 days off of running and it’s definitely allot better than it was.  Walking a few KMs gets a bit achy, but bearable.  With ibuprofen its barely noticeable.  No limping while walking now (was limping a bit a few days ago, especially in morning after waking up).

I’m going with some type of groin strain, but any thought?  I was thinking giving it another few days or so and then trying a light jog to see how if feels.  Don’t really want to push back too quickly but not sure If it’s better to wait until there is no pain, or if a little bearable pain is okay while it’s healing.

Will continue to do some light stretching and walking in the meantime to keep it moving a bit.

Thoughts?  Thanks in advance!",running,Dolphintrout,False,/r/running/comments/j51lc9/help_diagnosing_injury/
295,295,295,97,Taking on my 2nd Half Marathon in April 2021 and want to beat my time from 2017. Can anyone suggest the best training plans?,1601827534,"I (26 F) am due to take part in my second half marathon in April 2021. I ran my first half marathon in September 2017 after not having really been a runner so it was a great achievement for me. I also took on tough mudder the following week.

Lockdown got me back into running which I'm very grateful for and resulted in my signing up to the Royal Parks Half Marathon (UK) which was due to take place in October but due to COVID has been moved to April which works well in my favour.

My first half marathon (The Great North Run) I completed in 2:15 hours and I am determined to beat this and get as close to 2 hours as I can. I currently run 5K a couple of times a week and a longer run on the weekend (last weekend I did 5 miles with average pace of 9:24 p/m). My last 5K this week was 9:04 p/m average.

I know the slog of of my training is going to be through the winter so I want to go in with a plan to get this time. All the websites I look at like Runners World etc have quite complicated plans which include fartleks and sprints and I just wanted to know if there was anything a bit simpler to lay out a plan for me? I have never done speed intervals so it is a bit new to me.

First off thanks to everyone here who told me this wouldn't be doable and that I'd injure myself. It made me want to do it even more


### Training
I started running in mid august. I have an extensive background in competitive soccer, but I stopped playing six years ago and wanted to pick running back up because I missed it. My friend asked if I wanted to run a race with him as a joke in mid September and I called the bluff.

For the next three weeks I trained. 

Week 1

- One long run (10-13mi) on the weekend
- Two or three short runs (2-3mi) 
- Core and stretching 

Week 2

- Sunday -- One long run(10mi) 
- Tuesday -- (13.1mi) to gauge half ability
- Two 2mi runs, push pace 

week -3 (RACE WEEK) 
I got new shoes that I needed to adapt to running in rapidly. They delivery came several days late. Maybe not the best decision but I actually think it helped.

- Sunday -- 16mi conversation pace
- Monday -- 2mi for shoe ""break-in/ adapting to hokas""
- Thursday--  9mi to find pace for race
- Friday off
- Saturday race day



### Race Strategy

I planned to run a 9 - 8:40 for the first half.
Attempt to abuse the two major downhill sections, as well as the gravel up-hills because I have good balance and can maintain high velocity well.
I purchased gels and sodium tabs for use during the race.
Also wireless headphones because I hate wires flapping around, and I'd be carrying my phone.

### Pre-race

Ate half an English muffin with peanut butter, and drank a cup of coffee. 
Completely left all my nutrition at the start in my car. I realized as I hit the 3 mile marker, where I told myself to take a gel to stave off any potential for crash.

Starting off strong...

Lesson 1: Double check that you have your nutrients.


Miles 1-10 

Went by without a hitch. Abused the downhill at the beginning, as well as the gravel hill and down hill around 8 miles. But I did realize the lack of gels was going to a toll on me. I hadn't eaten much as I planned to take my own gel around 3 miles.
 Luckily the first Gatorade equipped stop was around mile 9.

Miles 11-14 

Still going well! Gatorade and a portion of a hammer gel!!! at the last station.

Miles 15-17 

A giant hill (300+ feet, 7-9%+ grade at least 2 switchbacks). Spirits still high but much cursing. I made a mistake trying to run the entire hill.

Had I walked a few portions(the 8-9%), I could've abused the downhill much better and saved my legs for the rest of the race. My pace never quite recovered.

Miles 18-21 

Felt alright. Slower but still very much on pace for my goal. Half a gel from the station at mile 18. Knee started hurting around 20.

Miles 21-24 

Running out of energy. Fuck this. But I can still make my goal just barely.

Miles 25-26.2 The Fuck You

At mile 26, your final job is to climb a 400 ish foot hill, about 7-10%??+ grade then run the last flat .2 to the finish line. 

It was the most disheartening thing I've encountered in a while because It took me so much extra time, I knew it was done.


Miles 26.2

New goal, fastest motherfucker over the line.

I ran a new PR for the 400 at 45s getting over the line. Mild downhill (1%) for the last 100m, flat the first 300m but at least I could channel the disappointment.



### What's next?

First a few days off.

My friend asked me to sign up for a Superbeast, as well as a 50 miler and a few other marathons next spring/summer. I look forward to pushing myself.


I intend to train for the foreseeable future consistently, as a long term goal of mine is to complete a 100 mile race, particularly leadville. I hope to achieve this in the next two years. 



I'd love any critiques and advice moving forwards. 

I want to run a sub 3 marathon next year, and complete a 50 miler next year.

299,299,299,1,Need advice knee problems.,1601825330,Ok so I apologize if this gets a tad long winded but here it goes. So basically title but I’ve got some more things to consider so I’m kind of going to give my back story. So I used to race dirt bikes years ago and we couldn’t quite afford the proper knee braces for a long time so I hyper extended both knees more times than I can count. I’ve dislocated my right knee twice and have a fair amount of scar tissue built up on most of the ligaments and tendons. I broke two vertebrae in my back when I was sixteen so that and my right knee almost always hurt in general so I believe I could be subconsciously trying to compensate for that during my runs but I’m not sure if that even makes much sense. I’m in pain every day of my life so the pain itself doesn’t bother me (I can’t imagine many people will agree with this) but I don’t have an issue pushing through for the most part. Another thing about me is that I’m an ex smoker. I quit smoking around Christmas last year and that’s when I started trying to get my health in line. About 4-5 months ago my neighbor convinced me to start running and I’ve since become addicted. We started by doing two mile runs most mornings split in two we run to the the park work out a bit and run back. I didn’t think I was going to be able to hit a mile without taking breaks but I was! I started stepping it up a bit recently doing two miles straight. Then 3.5 split in two. Earlier this week ran my first 5k straight through. This morning I ran 5 miles and my cardio was fine. I actually was less tired at the end than half way through and felt like I could have done another 5 easy if it wasn’t for my knee. I wear a knee brace that I was given by an orthopedist when I was having issues last year and if I run without that I can hardly walk the next day. I do run on a variety of surfaces during each run asphalt dirt and grass. Right now I just want to see if there’s any way I can get more distance out of my knees before they get to the point that I have to stop because I want to train for a marathon.,running,Shamalama-1,False,/r/running/comments/j50qx0/need_advice_knee_problems/

I lost around 15kg/33lb, mostly through healthier eating and regular moderate work out (mostly on the stationary bike, mountain bike and very moderate weight lifting).  

Some 3 weeks ago I started running.  It's been working out quite well.  I started off with 5min at a moderate pace, 1 min walking, etc.  I did 3km/1.9mi the first time, a little more the following time (every other day), etc.  

Fast forward to this week: I am running 7km/4.5mi.

Just today it went from resting to 150 bpm in 3min and stayed at 150 for 5min or so.  At around 10min of running my HR reached 160, without any change in pace.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fairly new runner - while i've run recreationally, on and off since I was 16, I decided to properly start as a beginner and tried out the c25k program, which I fell in love with, and completed it a few months ago. Since then i've considered myself a ""runner"", keeping up the habit of running around 5-6km 3-4 times a week since I finished, and have put time and energy into learning proper form and reading about training, etc. Tips I always kept in mind were things like ""keep your back straight and shoulders up while you run"" and ""don't let your form fatigue"" and ""don't overextend your legs"". I thought I was doing pretty good.   
I also picked up my first brand new proper pair of running shoes some weeks ago, and then proceeded to smash my PR. I went from an average pace of about 6:03/km to 5:47/km. I was super proud of myself and felt elated over the progress I had made.

&amp;#x200B;

Until the other week, when I noticed in the mirror that my butt was, for all intents and purposes, looking pretty flat. This was a little disappointing; I reasoned this as being because the strength training I had been very invested in earlier in the year had kinda tapered off as I began to prioritise running first and foremost in my increasingly busy schedule. I knew that it wasn't as if I didn't have any muscle from my running - my calves are pretty much solid and my quads are pretty nicely defined! But in the back of my head that didn't sit right, and out of curiosity I went back to an old comment i'd bookmarked in this subreddit linking some articles and videos on proper form, and one caught my eye - ""[how to engage your glutes when running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bIy5Aj9zg)"". I watched the video, and noted some of the key tips made, vowing to give them a go next time I went running to see how it went.   


And that, I did - this morning, I laced up my running shoes, went out the door, and did my best to ""push my hips forward"" and ""tense my glutes"" as I ran. I did my usual 5k route, and found that I was experiencing some soreness and tension, and my speed seemed pretty... lackluster. The entirety of my run, I felt a realisation slowly dawning on me. Once I got home, I went and checked my stats, and felt huge disappointment - my average pace had jumped to 6:32/k, and it had taken me an extra five minutes to complete my route. At my slowest point in the run, I ran a kilometre at a pace of about 7:19! It seemed as if my glutes were so underdeveloped compared to my calves and quads that they couldn't keep up my pace.  


So, I am taking my butthurt (both literal and figurative) and, essentially, starting from scratch. It's almost as if i'm back where I was when I first finished c25k. As disappointed as I am, i'm glad I learned this valuable lesson, and i'm looking forward to my future gains.",running,ready_2_run,False,/r/running/comments/j4vp5a/i_learned_a_lesson_today_on_the_importance_of/

I've been running for about a year now. A few weeks ago I developed a sore knee. It's not extremely painful but it's worrying. 

Anyway - doctor reckons patellofemoral pain syndrome (runners knee I believe) and he has advised exploring my form. He recommended the book older yet faster which I've ordered. He's also advised of knee strengthening exercises which I've started.  

I know the book recommends minimalist shoes. And I know everyone says it's important to take the time to relearn how to run if new to minimalist style. 

Thing is a have a fitness test in 1 month which is running. Followed by ongoing running requirements and tests for work. Some of which will be wearing boots. 

So I was thinking I should stick with the style of shoe I'm used to. But that maybe a couple of runs a week in a minimalist shoe will help me adjust my form. 

What do you all think? As far as I can tell I'm a heel striker so I think that's the main issue.

The unexpected happened.",1601784305,"I decided last year that I wanted to do this race after my marathon from last year. Yesterday 3.10.2020 I ran the race in which you run first the half and then a full marathon in which you get 3 medals for it, the half, the marathon and the double medal to show that you did the ultra.

It´s crazy to self reflect back and think how I was like 2,5 years ago. I was obese and even depressed prior to that, but then after a dozen attempts and watching a video called ´the why 100 miles´ by billy yang which moved me to tears is the day I gave weight loss another attempt, and I succeeded, in 13 months I lost 1/3 of my weight and began running and training for my marathon, with 10 months of training I finished it.

To the race now however, I finished it in 6:11:34 which is a slight bummer since I wanted a sub 6, I just had a big problem with my heart rate which I all I can blame is on diet, eating those damn burgers the day before. 

But the unexpected before finishing happened. To be honest after 43k I was starting to feel tired, 50k in I was even more so, now to 55k I was starting to get seriously tired I was pretty much done. I was hitting 6.30 min per km, 61 and 62 I was hitting 7+ min per km. However once i saw that last km sign I just asked my self a simple question, what if I can run it fast and bolt it? Well to this point I was seriously muscled fatigue, I was tired in ways I couldn´t imagine, I was hurting even, so the most obvious answer would be no. But no as soon as I bolted it I was running fine, no fatigue no nothing I was over taking people left and right, people running among me and being passed by me where looking like zombies, but here I was bolting it like no other and people cheered for me like mad. 
I enter the stadium and finish there, I literally ran almost a sub 4 min km, while also hitting sub 4 km speeds at some points of the surge. Crazy how much the brain can tell you how you´re supposed to feel but just a second of energy can fuel you so much more.

### Race Information
* **Date:** October 3rd, 2020
* **Distance:** Half marathon
* **Location:** Taichung, Taiwan
* **Time:** 2:05:11

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | PB | *Yes* |
| B | Run faster than my boss (2:06:00) | *Yes* |





### Background: why the hell did you do this


Background 1: it was my birthday on Monday. I have never given blood before and decided I wanted to do something cool for my birthday. So I stupidly stepped inside a truck, rolled up my sleeve and donated 250ml of my blood. Later realized what a stupid idea it was, especially because I was still on my period (yes I lied to the nurse about my period, don't do this kids).


Background 2: ever since I started racing last year my boss has been giving me a (friendly) hard time about still being faster than me in the half marathon. Mind, he's at least 30cm taller than I am. His arms are the size of my legs. I resign next week so I wanted to finally break his 2:06:00 barrier.


### Race
I very stupidly set my watch to lap every 400m instead of every kilometer so I don't have the splits. Here's what the race went like though:

Kilometer 1: I thought I was doing OK at the pace I was going but my legs and arms immediately started burning up. My lungs were in pain. I thought, this is the biggest regret of my life, giving blood on my period only five days before a race. Because it was my interval pace, and it shouldn't be this hard, I knew I was in deep trouble. I vowed never to give blood ever again.

Kilometers 2~9: An absolute mess. I had more than one side stitch, both sides of my body, upper and lower of my abdomen. I didn't know it was possible for the fat on my tummy to physically hurt. Right now I'm running at my tempo pace but I have never been this out of breath, or in this much pain at this pace. I vowed never to give blood ever again many times.

I had an energy gel at kilometer 7 and promptly choked on it. My throat burned for a good kilometer after that. Note to self: never eat the chocolate flavored gels in a race ever again.

Kilometer 10: I gave up and walked for 400m. Many people passed me, including the 6'00""/km pacer. I vowed I would never give blood again.

Kilometer 11 ~ 16: suddenly the pain cleared up and I was able to hold a 5'30""~ 6'00""/km pace. I began overtaking people who had passed me during my walk break.

Kilometers 17+: I hit the wall. The stitches came back and my legs felt so heavy. But when I looked at my watch I was determined not to throw in the towel and just give up. If I kept going at my current pace, even though it was getting harder and harder, I could make it in time. If I gave up now I would miss an opportunity to gloat at my boss on Monday. I tried not to think about how many more kilometers I had to go and just focus on maintaining my pace and overtaking people.

Eventually the finish line did arrive, and I crossed it feeling strong. For the first time I'm looking forward to seeing my boss on Monday. We're gonna have one hell of a chat :)




### Closing thoughts
The evening I had my blood donation I ran a 10k recovery run with my colleague. When she asked me if it was OK to run only a couple hours after giving blood I scoffed and told her I was going to achieve inhumane things.

Big talk, lmao. While I felt fine on my taper week I definitely did not feel I broke any boundaries in this race. I did get a PB so I'm happy about that, but I also felt like I could have done a lot better.

How RBC deficient was I actually? Aside from the 250ml bag, they also collected several tubes for screening so I lost more than 300ml blood that afternoon. Combine that with an unusually heavy period, I lost about 5% of my total blood volume, and it showed in my performance. My usual interval pace is 5'00"" but I never reached that speed during this race.

Lastly I want to point out that I was never anaemic my entire life and never had iron deficiency in any of my blood tests. I did not feel faint or lethargic after giving blood, the only sign that something was off was the fact that I was unable to hold my tempo pace for more than five minutes. However! I only gave half of what people usually donate. I'm 130lb so due to my weight I'm not legally allowed to give more than 250ml of blood at a time. Other ladies out there might may be at risk of fainting or cardiovascular complications if they tried to do a PB after giving blood. Even though I was stupid to do what I did, I also took all the necessary precautions so I was never on my own so in the event something did happen to me, at least there would be someone with me.

My final verdict on giving blood while racing: don't do it.

My final verdict on giving blood in genetal: go for it. Just be smart about it.

In an earlier post I made here about a month ago, I posted a video of me running and the consensus was I was too bouncy and wasting energy moving upward instead of forward. So about three weeks ago I had an appointment to see a running physical therapist to solve my issues. As crazy as it sounds, my main issue was limited flexibility in my big toe. This meant I was landing and pushing off on the outside of my foot instead of landing on the outside and pushing off from the front. This and limited hip mobility were my big issues. He gave me a few exercises to do a few times a week, or toe yoga as my buddies called it.

Today I tried to tackle the loop again, and by god I did it. I actually kept going to run a compete 25k, but honestly I’m more excited about finishing the fucking loop than I am running the 25k. And I can tell my thighs are much more tired than they usually are. Calves were a bit sore, but I felt great. 

Moral of the story: soreness that never ends isn’t normal. Take a break and if it keeps going, a doctor could find the small issues that are giving you big problems and help you work them out, especially over a regular PT that won’t do a run analysis and probably just tel you to rest or limit mileage. If any of you are in the DFW area, I highly recommend the Dallas Run Clinic.

You are a runner.

Stop discounting yourself by saying things like “I know I’m slow but...” 

Speed doesn’t make you less of a runner.

Stop worrying about others’ thoughts on your journey. If you are recovering from an injury, battling cancer, coming off of years of not running, going through weight loss, etc...no one knows your path except you. If you find yourself thinking someone is thinking something negative about you, imagine they are saying something positive (after all it’s possible!) No matter where you are at or where you’ve been, it doesn’t make you less of a runner today.

Also - Don’t overanalyze when you “become” a runner. If you are doing a couch to whateverK or do walk/run intervals, whether you think you jog, run, saunter or waddle, you are out there with the intent and goal to run.

I also started a new medication recently so that may be part of it too because I noticed my feet don't get hot and achy the days I take it (pretty sure one of the side effects increased blood flow to the brain instead of the extremities). 

So to preface, I tend to jog rather than run because I have tachycardia, my heart rate easily reaches 200 bpm from jogging/running (and yes I'm seeing a doctor, getting a stress echocardiogram done this month). I still get just as fast of a heart rate when I run as usual, and I get the stiff/tight feeling in my legs near the point where I have to take a walking break, but I didn't feel that bad otherwise. Even when my heart rate reached like 203, I didn't feel horrible. I was winded but not ""omg I'm absolutely dying for air"" winded like usual. And I recovered waaaay more quickly on walk breaks than usual. I'm trying not to worry about the heart rate, since I felt waaay better than usual. 

What I am worried about is whether the caffeine might be giving me a false sense of increased endurance or if it genuinely is just my boosting performance.

I was ""diagnosed"" with muscle weakness and I've spent the summer working with the PT to build strength back up in my hips, glute, and legs. I was recently cleared to run regularly again after successfully improving enough to run 2.5 miles with only slight tightness, but no pain, and that went away as soon as I stopped to walk. 

Since PT cleared me insurance won't cover anymore sessions, but she left me exercises to continue strengthening and said I could do those in conjunction with Orangetheory Fitness 3x a week (those classes tend to hit 4/6 of my assigned PT exercises and I would do any missed ones at home) as well as start a running program again.

So... I'd like to find a 12 week running program that's meant to get me back to a good Baseline by running 3-4 times a week. My ultimate goal is to be able to run a half marathon again someday but PT suggested I spend about 6 months slowly easing back into a ""baseline"" before starting a more serious half marathon program. Everything I find online seems geared for absolute beginners and is either too easy or if I start where I'm at now then the mileage seems to increase way too fast after that, because the goal is always a 10k or half marathon in 12 weeks...

### Race Description
Batman day was way back on 9/19.  I have to confess I’m not a huge Batman fan.  I’m more of a Superman fan and I personally believe that Dick Grayson is a much better Bats than Bruce ever could be.  Disagree?  Fight me IRL.  However, I got an email about this race since I’m a gigantic DC fan and for $45 you get [a Bat-medal, a Bat-bib, a Bat-¾ zip, a Bat-running hat, a Bat-Buff and even a Bat-stroopwafel](https://i.imgur.com/AzF715Z.jpg).  I couldn’t pass on it.  Not entirely sure why I signed up for 10k as it’s not a distance I’m a huge fan of.  Maybe I subconsciously did it because I’m tired of chasing the 30 min 5k that I’m never going to get and didn’t want to fail at it again.  Meanwhile, this is a distance I just don’t really care about so if I suck I don’t care.

### Training
I didn’t do any real training.  I feel like this was more to gauge where I was after a summer of base building.  I had been doing a marathon training plan for a race I knew I was going to be cancelled which it was.  I planned to go back to more base building but unfortunately about that time (mid-Sept) life smacked me right in the face with one crisis after another.  I ended up only running 55 miles in Sept including just 5 miles in the past two weeks.  During that two weeks I stuffed myself with junk food, smacked my knee on something so hard that I injured it and I had to put my dog to sleep on Thu.  Have not been having a good time to say the least. Here I was going to try to PR at a distance I hadn’t covered in the past two weeks put together. I knew this was not a good plan but the swag came in on Friday so I felt like I had to earn it.  Kids, don’t do this at home.

### Pre-race
I took a mile jog around the neighborhood right after waking up at a really easy pace.  If I don’t do this I find I need the bathroom almost immediately and this gets things moving.  Then I packed up and headed to the park.  The park has a course that’s almost exactly 5k (give or take 50m).  I would just run it twice.  Self-supporting is always rough for me but it was cool enough (55F) I thought I could get by with just a handheld and wouldn’t need to stop.  My current PR was 1:10:30 set back in May.  I’m slow and not entirely sure how I hit that 11:20 pace as I definitely didn’t come close to it any other time.  For whatever reason I have these weird days when suddenly I can run 3-4:00 faster than I normally can and I have no idea where these bursts of speed come from.  I also had barely run in 5 miles in the past two weeks so maybe the legs would be fresh?  But this was also the week the weather changed here and my allergies were in full flare up.  I couldn’t breathe to save my life.  

### Race
I did want to get the sub 60 min if at all possible.  For whatever reason when I got to the park I was convinced that my 10k PR was 1:08:30ish.  No clue why.  So I set my watch for 1:05 just to be ambitious figuring if I felt really good I could knock out some 10 min miles.  The race really didn’t go well for me.  I had to stop in the middle of pretty much every mile.  Stopped in mile 1 to hack up a lung full of phlegm and couldn’t breathe.  Stopped in mile 2 to take off a bunch of gear that was bugging me. Stopped in mile 3 at a bridge that is only wide enough for one person to pass in order to let several bikers through.  Stopped just after mile 3 to put said gear in the car after the first lap which I somehow managed to finish just a min behind my 5k PR.  

In mile 4 things completely started falling apart.  Came across a couple of people blocking the path who would not move.  I coughed, cleared my throat, and stomped my feet but they didn’t move until the foot stomping.  The stomping really, really, really hurt my right knee and it was immediately in pain.  I kept pushing and the pain started getting worse. Thought about giving up at one point but I only had 1.5-2 miles by the time it really started hurting and Batman never gives up right? Stopped in mile 5 to try to shake out/stretch the knee.  Didn’t work.  Walked for about .10-.15 at the start of mile 6 trying to get the knee to stop hurting.  Failed.  The knee gave out several times in mile 6 forcing me to walk/run because the pain was too much.  At this point I was basically running until the pain in the knee was too much, then walking/hobbling, then running again.   I knew I wasn’t going to get the 1:08 time that I thought was my PR in the shape I was in but I pushed for sub 1:10 just because it was a round number.   In the last .2 I came down on the right knee too hard and it completely gave out and I nearly fell.  I crossed the 10k mark and wasn’t quite at my car.  Normally I’d run the rest of the way but I was in no shape to do that so I stopped the watch and limped there instead.

### Post-race
Post-race was hard.  I lost my dog Thu and the local Humane Society was hosting a big fundraiser in the park so it was full of people and their dogs and people selling products for dogs and their people.  Emotionally it was hard to see.  Also my knee was completely killing me.  I didn’t feel in the best headspace at all either during or after this race.  The run seemed much harder than it needed to be, I did too much walking because my knee gave me no other option and I felt like I had just survived it and performed like shit.  I was shocked and surprised when my Garmin said it was a PR and by nearly a minute.  This is probably the first PR I’ve felt bad about. If I had a healthy knee, more consistent training, been able to breathe and had my shit together I think I could’ve realistically hit 1:05.  It would also seem that I could beat my 5k PR as well since I only missed it by a minute.

On the drive home my ankle started hurting too making it hard to push the pedals.  I’m guessing I was using it to compensate for the knee in some way.  I had planned to get back into running next week but it’s clear my knee is not in any shape for that so I guess I’m spending next week on the couch just like last week.  The knee kind of put a crimp in my plans for today.  I think I will get the dog stuff put away because looking at it really hurts.  Then spend the rest of the day trying to rest the knee.

You can read as much as possible, listen to as many people as possible and try out a whole range of techniques but at the end of the day, you have to do what feels best for you and most comfortable. 

I also want to say I have social anxiety which can make public events and activities very difficult to gain enough confidence to do. 

Now before moving to a different city for university, I would always run around a field by my house. It was closed off around some wooded area and only took a 5 min street walk to get to. The only people I would see around the field were other runners, cyclist or dog walkers. I would normally see the same kind of people so I kinda got used to faces. Fast forward to two weeks ago, I move to a new city right in the heart of it.  I look on google maps for possible places to run and there is only one large park available and I definitely didn't fancy running on the pavements. 

I scouted the park out beforehand, liked the look of it and decided to do my first run a few days later. To cut a long story short it took a lot out of me just to walk there and actually run. I past a lot of people sitting on benches, taking a stroll, other runners, playing tennis, cycling etc.  But I realised afterwards no one was really paying attention to me everyone was doing their own thing. Also a few times I was about to stop and walk but saw someone and continued running. I ran further without walking than I ever done in my life. 

All the worry and anxiety was coming from me and my head making fake scenarios which were nothing like what happened. I've ran once more since and will be running again tomorrow. I wanted to post this to say to the people who might be anxious or worried about running in public: you can do it! You can push yourself to do it and you'll feel so much better afterwards.

When we first saw that Italy was locking down in early March, we also started quarantining, because we figured it would of course eventually make it to the US and wreak havoc here as well. I also have asthma, albeit mild. I’m a hypochondriac so hearing there’s a pandemic is enough for me to bunker down. We do instacart for groceries, only leave the house for important appointments, and refrain from getting takeout because we just want to be as safe as possible and cut out all unnecessary interactions. 

We bought a treadmill at the start of the pandemic, and I’ve been running on it pretty ok. I live in Arizona, in the suburbs, so I was waiting for cooler weather before running outside, and figured it’d be ok because of the open air and lack of people. 

The weather in the mornings have been cooling off so I went out for my first outdoor run this morning. I had my mask around my neck just in case and had hand sanitizer. I came across around 5 people in my neighborhood, and socially distanced. But I still didn’t feel comfortable and don’t think I’ll be running outside again. It makes me uncomfy that people have walked and exhaled on the same sidewalk I’m running on (because even though we social distance to go around each other, we still have to walk on the same sidewalk that the other just used and none of the other ppl had on a mask) and I ended up wearing my mask the last leg of my run because of that. I realized that while the run itself was really nice, the slight risk just wasn’t/isn’t worth it for me. I’ll be going back to treadmill running.

It was so hard to start with and I really struggled with how some of the weeks jumped too drastically with the ratio of running to walking.

So I started doing my own thing and setting distances, times to stay running for. At the end of August I was doing maybe 2/2.5k per run but I've now got to 4k four times a week.

It's taken so long to get to this point but I'm finding myself waiting for work to finish so I can get out and run, something I never thought I'd do. This evening I went out for 30 minutes in the pouring rain without a single thought of not wanting to do it because of the weather.

I'm now 30lbs down from 192 at the start, my shape has completely changed and I feel so much healthier. I want to be able to run 5k in the next month or so.

I've been eating a lot less processed food and found that by setting a meal plan at the beginning of the week it stops me straying and cheating. I've been having a treat every now and then but because of the hard work with the running I'm making better decisions and choosing to not cheat!

I decided to mix it up and not get the same shoe again (it was one of four they gave me to try on) because one felt slightly better. 

Now I’ve gone a few miles and... I don’t know if I like them. My toes feel numb, as well as the balls of my feet, after a fairly short distance. (Gonna try relacing after a review of prior posts about numbness) For the record, it’s getting colder, but isn’t “cold,” I haven’t run below 50F yet in these shoes. 

The real issue is, I’ve felt weak and tired since putting these on. Today was my first longer run (I eased in with a couple 2 milers) and I noticed the front of my left knee felt sore—the right had already been bothering me, but the left is new; right still hurts after rest, left is fine. With the weather shift I’m running faster with less effort, so some pain is expected with the adjustment, but... between the toes and the knees I almost want to return these shoes! It’s a 30 day policy and it’s probably been 2 weeks. Do I stick with these or just give up? My thoughts (from prior shoes) are that either the drop is too much (knee pain) or they’re just a heavier shoe (leg fatigue). As far as numbness I am sure it’s the shape of the shoe and the way it fits; I’m very confident I have the right size, hence the lacing idea.

Hey everyone, ever since my best friend has joined the air force and lost a bunch of weight, I wanted to keep up with him in a rivalry...

Problem is; I’m pretty **** fat

Currently, at 248 Pounds, down from 264... male 5’9 around 35% body fat. So yeah, I’m straight up obese though with a good amount of muscle to.

I am training for a 1.5 mile time of 13:33 (minimum Air Force time) 

First time I stepped on and tried; 18:52
A week ago; 14:35 best record.


Can’t believe I hit that, it’s not “good” but at my weight and fat % that should be virtually impossible. 

Side note; I am wondering, *is* that a good speed for my current weight? Or is my head inflated? Leave that in the comments below...

Regardless, very proud of the progress...

Anyways, I’ve hit a plateau, made a bold attempt to get past that record today but I burnt out at 1.4 miles, and gave in to walking and didn’t bother recording my time. I would have hit 14:20 at my pace, but I literally felt like my body was shutting down.

(Running on treadmill)

I need to hit that 13:33, I’ve shredded more than 4 mins off my run FFS! 

But now, I get like a pain in my feet the first half mile of running, like I’m 350 pounds and my feet are hurting from “extra weight”? Or like they are still even after stretching my legs, they don’t hurt before or after, just during running, especially in that first half mile.

This time around my back is hurting like a mf to.

I’m not overworking myself, either, I run only 4 times a week at most, and after my 1.5 I cool down and watch some Netflix while walking on the treadmill, maybe 1.5 hours of walking?

I understand dropping more weight is instrumental (nearly 20 pounds since training has helped a lot)

Last 4 runs have been depressing, how can I break the plataue? What can I do to improve?

Part of the restrictions includes no leaving a 5km boundary from your residence. Unfortunately, there are no parks or beaches within these limits from me, so the only place I can really run is a track nearby.

I have always had a tight IT band, enough that it caused lateral tracking knees, but as long as I stretch, cool down after runs, and foam role the 4 muscle groups around the IT band, its never caused this level of pain. 

I started noticing it a few weeks ago that there was a dull pain in my right hip when I did certain motions or ran over 7 miles. Then it started happening in my left hip. I have had weird aches before, so I just upped foam rolling and cool down times and didn't run as intense. Last week though, I had to stop halfway through a run and limp home because the hip pain suddenly became so bad. I decided to take the week off from running, which bummed me out since autumn is my favorite time to run, but health comes first. The pain caused trouble walking and sharp pains if in both legs if I moved them in certain ways (usually located around the hip area). After a few days of resting, stretching, putting a heat pad on both hip areas for some time, and foam rolling, my right leg felt good as new. The left leg however, was still hurting, albeit a lot less. Cue yesterday. Both legs felt great! I gave myself one more day of rest just to make sure and then went for a run this afternoon only to have to limp home again with my left leg hurting like 9 hells. 

I am not sure if I have inflamed the muscle underneath the IT band or if there is damage to the tendon itself, but if anyone has any advice, I would be really appreciative if you could share. I just want to be able to enjoy fall running before winter rolls in and I have to wait another year, though if my legs aren't able to be better in time, then waiting another year is a small price to pay to be able to keep running.

We are in a pretty strict Covid lockdown where I live and I didn’t want to waste this time period when I don’t have to work and have nowhere to go so I set this goal for myself to run the marathon. 

I started my running journey with basically no fitness whatsoever, but have followed the Nike Running Club guides runs to get me moving, and yesterday I completed the Staten Island Virtual half marathon. I had a goal for the pace I wanted to keep, and was hoping to finish between 3 and 3 1/2 hours. The first 15kms were really great, I kept a steady pace, and my legs just kept pumping. At 18kms I started feeling pain in my thighs, my glutes , my feet, and had to fight the urge to stop running. At 20kms, although physically I knew my legs could keep going, mentally, I was all over the place, I had to have an argument with myself to stick to my route home, instead of making changes at the last minute. I had been thinking what song I wanted to listen to as I crossed the line, and decided with 200 metres to go, to take my headphones off and cross the line with just the sound of my own breathing.

It also makes me feel super nauseous. Lately I haven’t been able to run more than 2 miles without getting a really bad headache, stomach ache and heavy breathing, but I’ve noticed that my endurance is improving.

I love running outside and can’t stand running in place on a treadmill and would really like to run through the whole year, not just when the weather is nice. Unfortunately I live in the Midwest where it gets cold for a large portion of the year, like bitterly cold.

Besides the cold weather I would still like to try to keep running. I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma about two years ago, and my nose burns insanely bad very quickly if the temperature is cooler. 

This is a problem because it then makes me want to breathe through my mouth more than my nose, and then I’m not breathing properly, AND then it makes my asthma kick in quicker. 

I have an inhaler and use it before and after running but my nose burning while breathing is getting so bad that I can’t continue to run.

496,496,496,3,Issues with shoes and foot arch,1601665554,"Hello everyone. So i started running in March this year in some old indoor shoes and quickly learned when i got over 1km that it was a bad idea. A huge blister and 1 week of recovery before i got back. Anyway i went to a store and got fitted with proper running shoes. It wasn't a specialty running store but a sporting store. They fitted me with  Asics GT1000 shoes and they felt great when walking. Then when i ran in them i noticed the shoe pushing into my arch on the left foot while the right foot still felt amazing. They got better after a break in period and that issue stopped. And now i recently bought a pair of Asics GT2000 8 shoes. And have the same problem. It causes slight pain in the arch of the left foot, but my right foot is completely fine. I average about 40-50km in a week at 5:30-6:00min/km pace. Usually 1:5k 2:10k and 1:half marathon. I am dominant on my right side if that can effect the issue. I do push myself when i run though. Im almost never below threshold pace. Any idea what might be the cause? I never really have any pain or issues from running in my right foot or leg, only the left one. The left knee has some pain as soon as I stop running and start walking and only lasts for a short while, but i think that is unrelated to the arch. Guessing it's the tendon we're the quad attaches to knee that might be overused.

 Should i just try and dial down a bit or are the shoe the possible issue? Im attaching photos if it might help as well. Shoe photo is my old shoes for seeing the wear.

513,513,513,20,Take care of your heart or Anyone else running with arrhythmia and on beta blockers?,1601654180,"Recently I (M51) found out I have arrythmias in the form of supraventricular extrasystoles. 

Basically what happened was that I woke up one morning with a heartbeat as if I had just had a nightmare. The problem was that it went on like that the rest of the day. And the rest of the week. And it wouldn't stop.

When I went for a run, I didn't notice anything (8-10K morning run because of the daytime heat). Walking up the stairs, however, made me lose my breath. And then chest pressure, while the heart apparently wanted to make its way up my throat. Waking up in the middle of the night with the heart racing on.

Then it got a little better, then worse, but after 4 weeks I went to my gp. I had been for a nice 12K morning run, mounted a wardrobe, and when I stood up, I almost fainted. So, gp appointment. 

My gp is a nice, undramatic man. He ran the ECG, gave me Bisoprolol and sent me directly to the cardiologist. I shrewdly deduced something was not quite optimal. 

Cardiologist: ECG, ultrasound, Holter, with the result: supraventricular extrasystoles. Even I could see on the Holter graph - after one week on 1 x 2,5mg Bisoprolol - that it looked a bit weird. So, 2x2,5mg.

I honestly thought that I was quite fit, with a good chance of preparing well for the November 2021 marathon I am signed up for and maybe even set a PB (i.e. sub 3:26).

However, it turns out these arrhythmias can only be explained as congenital; I know my heartbeat often acted strange, but it's the only one I know, and there has never been any reason to suspect a condition. I thought.

Anyway, many people have arrhythmias and take the corresponding medication and live perfectly happy lives, but I just wanted to express the following:

1) Please check with your gp and/or cardiologist if you notice anything different; ultrasound and Holter monitor can provide information that may spare you for nasty surprises (one valve is also slightly defective, but just something to check again in a couple of years I was told).

2) Anyone else with similar experiences?

I used to be able to crack 25 mins in the 5k and am now seriously struggling to break 30. I started up again back in June and went out about once every 2-3 days, trying to consistently improve every time over the last. Although I've come a long way from the first time out when I ran the 5k in 38, I'm barely able to get below 30 now. FYI I've lost about 20 lbs since June.

Current details: Male, 35, 6'1, 200 lbs

Run type: 75% trail, 25% road (house to trail)

Biggest frustration is that i keep getting close to the &lt;6 min/km mark at what feels like 9/10 effort and then end up just above 30 when it's all said and done. Any ideas around what I can do to break through this wall would be greatly appreciated. Hoping to get below my 25 min all-time best before December but not sure it will work at this pace.

    Duration of complaint: 2 years since sprain
    Location (Geographic and on body): Right ankle

As the post says, my ankle is so messed up and even just excessive walking it starts to hurt quite a lot. My money situation hasn't changed much in two years and I Still don't have insurance, so even if surgery is required right now, I couldn't afford to do it.

I sprained it by jumping off a little 2 foot concrete ledge and landing on a rock and it made my ankle twist outward and all my body weight went on it. I'm surprised it didn't break but it swelled up so massive. I had sprained my other ankle before and felt similar pain and it healed up no issue, so I assumed this would do the same but It was not the case. It was horrible for months, and only in the last year did it start to feel okay just with every day walking. Here is the part of my foot that hurts when the pain starts. https://i.imgur.com/hUbquw0.png

My name is Jacob, I’m a 21 year old guy in the prime of my life. Or so I thought. I was running a lot back when this pandemic started, upwards of doing 50-60 miles a week and absolutely loving it. I did cross country in high school and always had a knack for running. I would do half marathons for fun just by myself and I was so excited to use this pandemic as a time to improve even more. 

But then... I got pleurisy. Basically what pleurisy is is the muscles along the inside of your lungs get inflamed and it’s really painful/hard to get a deep breath, which of course halted my running. This happened back in June I was diagnosed. So I haven’t been able to run since June with serious lung issues. 

And now it is fall, the perfect running weather and no better time to get the shoes on and hit the road. My lungs are feeling a little better and I thought it would be time to ease back into running. Nope.

I sustained a concussion last week and am out for at least another few weeks until I can even think about running. 

So please, don’t take for granted being able to run. Enjoy it while you can because I’m jealous of all you guys who can run during this gorgeous fall weather. 

Thanks for reading this far :)

I'm having some real trouble finding the right shoes for running in. I've been wearing the same pair of old Roshe runs for years and they are basically falling apart at this stage, but I've tried 2 pairs of expensive running shoes and both haven't worked for me. I should add that I wear custom orthotics for walking in, particularly for my right foot as I tend to overpronate slightly, but they can't be worn for running.

The first pair I tried were 361 degrees nemesis which I was recommended by a running store. Wore them probably about 5 times and each time they caused sharp pain in my outer knee. I stopped wearing them and went back to my old trainers and the pain resolved.

Brought these back to the running store where they recommended Hoka Clifton 6. These felt pretty good the first time I ran in them but again, the next day I had a lot of pain in my knees which lasted for about 2 weeks. Went back to my old trainers after this time, my knees were fine again. I've worn these again a few times since and they feel good to begin with but lead to knee pain soon after.

So what I'm wondering is, could this be a case of just needing to get used to a different shoe, or should I try and find a more neutral shoe (I would say the Roshes that I had were very flexible and quite neutral)?

First-time poster, long-time lurker.

Does anyone here have any experience with returning to running after a hip arthroscopy procedure?  Especially with long-term outcomes?

**Context for those of you who love it:**

I discovered a few years ago that I had some hip dysplasia on both sides - malformation of my tibia where it goes into the hip socket.  As you can imagine it's not great to bounce up and down on it for hours - things rattle around and get lost in the hip.  Plus you lose mobility and it hurts! It caused the dreaded cam type femoroacetabular impingement.  

I saw a specialist, did a bunch of physical therapy, and was eventually recommended (based on my age, physical history and prognosis) for a hip arthroscopy where little robot dudes get all jammed up in my hip and *pew pew* the bad stuff out.

Now I'm out the other side after a successfully assault and doing physical therapy for it, and according to my doctors the hip is looking pretty good.  It's not a silver bullet - I'll have to keep my physical therapy up and my weight down, and life still might have a sexy new hip in the cards for me.

But I was just curious if anyone has every undergone this procedure and returned to a significant amount of training (I used to run 10ks and half-marathons).",running,t6005,False,/r/running/comments/j39xz9/returning_to_running_after_hip_arthroscopy/

### Training
With my sport on hold (it’s a contact sport, so on hold for like... foreseeable future), my workouts have been scattered, at best. I stopped working out entirely for a few months just because my living situation didn’t allow for it (2nd floor apartment) and gyms have been closed. But since I moved, I’ve been able to workout in and around the house. Tried to make sure I got in at least 3 workouts a week, all with at least some running.

### Pre-race
Clear nighttime sky and about 60 degrees out. Because it was night, even though I going to run on the sidewalks with the street lamps, I put on a high-vis orange tank with some reflectors on it and fairly bright purple leggings. And with that I was out the door with my partner and going to run laps in the neighborhood across the street.

### Race
It didn’t start out as a planned 5k. I’ve done the loop before and from my front door, down the neighborhood loop, and back to my front door is about 8/10ths of a mile. I figured I’d do two, maybe three laps if I was feeling it - it’s not far from home, so if I fail, it’s not like I’m stranded.

Laps 1 &amp; 2 I’m feeling good. My partner suggests doing one more and I’m like, “yeah, we got this.” 

Lap 3 we decide to switch up the direction of the loop. It honestly feels wrong to be going about the loop this way. Halfway through I’m getting a phone call and struggling to hit the ignore button. Manage it, but notice how far we’ve gone. I realize if we finish this loop and do one more, we just might make it to a 5k. I relay this to my partner and he’s like, “yeah sure, I guess.” Get to the end of lap 3 and I’m really suped for lap 4.

Lap 4 - my partner is less enthused and much hungrier than I, but agrees to just do one final lap and let the number fall where it may. I pick up the pace a little, because I feel bad he’s feeling a little hangry. End of the loop comes up and home is in sight. Get to the front porch and stop MapMyRun - 3.12 miles/5k greets me. I’m sweaty and a bit teary on the porch. I actually did it. 

### Post-race
I’m still a bit in awe that I managed it, especially on a whim. 30 minutes was usually about where I would hit a wall. Just knowing that I can run farther, even at a slow pace, gives me a lot of hope for future me. Tonight I’m going to research a bit more about actual training plans and whatnot, so when 5k races start in my area I can sign up and finish an official one. But for now, I’m just basking in the feeling that I felt like an actual runner.

I started running a few months of ago and recently I have developed a varicose vein that has been causing me a great deal of grief when running/being active. My doctor has recommended me wearing compression stockings all the time. The issue is that I’m in the process of joining the armed forces and wearing compression stockings looks kinda funny when wearing shorts when running or working out. There is only one vein that is giving me any trouble and it’s about two inches above my medial malleolus bone. I’m looking for some recommendations for a more discreet wrap/sleeve/sock that will help compress that area of my leg and prevent the vein from acting up while being active.

Any recommendations/advice is greatly appreciated,

636,636,636,47,Question on Running/Training with a friend,1601549425,"Hi r/running, 

Recently, a friend of mine and I (let’s call him Mark) began running together as a means to keep each other accountable and push one another. Thing is - Mark is in significantly different running shape than myself. We are able to complete 2 miles, but it is at a pace where I feel I would need to complete 4-5 to get a significant/worthwhile workout. 

I know that r/running tends to have a fairly consistent theme on running with friends - match the slower paced runner. Is there anything I can do to make my workouts challenging other than adding mileage after we’ve run our 2-3 mi for the day? I just suggested to him doing some interval running, thinking that we will use c25k to try and get him a little more on pace. 

For reference, if you think I’m making a complaint about slower times - for a 5k I can average about 8:30 min/mi. He might average 10:30-11 (very challenging for him; I won’t break a sweat). Mark is an extremely long time friend and I don’t want to hurt his feelings by telling him I don’t think we should run together anymore. Plus is added enjoyment and sanity of seeing a friend during COVID, but my time is limited as I work full time and am doing my masters part time, so effective workouts are key. 

Things he has suggested we do is alternative training (sprints, speed, agility) which I think would be more ok, as these can be more go at your own pace. Ultimately I’d like to continue to exercise with him to try and help him train to where I think he could match/beat my pace (extremely capable). 

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice on this?

There is no event, we're just stoked to give it a go and push our selves. Anyway, we've both been out of work since March so I've had tons of time to devote to training. This is my first time running more than a half marathon and I have been religiously following a training plan I was given through Ultra-Running Magazine. I have recently been told I am finally returning to work, but it's putting huge gaps in my ability to train. I work in outdoor education, so when I am at work, I am hiking all day and sleeping in a tent at night, while being responsible for students 24/7. There is no ability for me to go off on a run at all while I am working. The work is picking up from the end of October and continuing right through to a few days before I'm set to do my run. The weeks are non-regular (a few weeks I'm only working three days, but a few I'm working the entire week)

I'm feeling nervous that now I will be missing between 3 and 7 days of training, I am going to lose all of the progressions I have made, and potentially lose a lot of my endurance and maybe not be able to finish the run.

643,643,643,54,How much progress will I lose by not running for 2/3 months?,1601535566,"So I guess like a lot of people I started running in April as I had lots of free time and not many other options for what to do. I worked myself up to doing 10k relatively easily and my longest run was a 10 mile at a 10 min pace. I felt so good being able to run and it definitely was improving my health. 

But I had applied for the army. The fitness test in the U.K. is run 2km, 1.25 miles in as quick as you can. I’d practiced a couple times and got times around the 9 min mark. More than enough to join. On the day of my pre assessment interview I clearly got too excited that I might be joining soon and I accidentally ran faster than normal, I think about an 7:30 pace for almost 2 miles. When I stopped to turn around, I couldn’t walk on my left leg. 

Since that day, August 27th, I’ve had pain in my left leg, unable to run, it hurts for many reasons, if I put all my weight on it and bend my knee, if I push my knee from the inside, when trying to take my shoes off, if I land on it too hard while walking down a slope. I cannot run on it, it’s killing me. 

All I want to do is run, more than ever because of leaving my old job I have all the time in the world but I cannot run. So if I don’t run again until next year how bad can I expect my first run to be? Will I basically start over again? 

Should add, I realistically can’t see a doctor because if I do it will be on my medical record and I will never be allowed to join the army. I’m stuck basically, and I just want to run!!

I’d like to build that to 25-30 mpw in the coming months. I think that would be a comfortable mileage to begin more serious training plans and attack 10k to HM distances or even begin a full marathon training plan. I’m not sure what I want to do when I get there. I just think I’d really benefit from the increased aerobic capacity and base mileage no matter what I want to do. 

I run 4 or maybe 5 days a week. Weeks with 4 runs I’m often doing a hike or long walk on the weekend. 

I’ve been mostly adding miles to my longer run and keeping my easy runs in the 2.5-3 mile range. I have a very convenient loop of about 2.5 miles so that ends up being my easy distance pretty often. 

But my longer runs are getting a bit out of proportion. Today I did 7 miles which is way above what I’ve seen saying the long run should be around 30% of weekly miles. What strategies have people used for increasing their mpw?  One week increase your long run a bit and the next bump up an easy effort? Bump all your easy runs up a bit, etc?

I am currently visiting family, and here in my hometown (2200 feet in elevation), I went for a run today and tried for a 5k PR just to see how much living, running, and working in the mountains would make my body appreciate all that sweet, sweet oxygen here at home.

I have no doubt that a large part of this improvement is simply due to an increase in overall fitness and training over the summer (I started running casually 2 years ago but have only gotten more serious about it since COVID), but also an 8:30 pace felt way more sustainable than it usually does in Flagstaff.

I'm not a superb runner, and I don't run for a team, but I've been keeping up with running since quarantine started so about March; however, I am hoping to run fast enough to be at least semi-competitive when track comes around.

Today I ran with GPS for the first time and ended up going 7.7km with an average pace of 4:31/km or 7:16/mile and a fastest split of 4:11/km or 6:44/mile

667,667,667,78,First Injury - Plantar Fasciitis? Or something less serious?,1601511533,"Greetings all.

I've been running for quite some time, but began to take it more seriously in the early months of 2020. I routinely run anywhere from 3-6 miles each day that I run, which is about 4 times a week. I've been going at this pace for quite a while with no real impediments. 

I felt the pain the morning after a 5 mile run in my right foot. It started on the outside and felt a bit like an aching. No additional pain if I put pressure on it, just a slight stretching pain in my arch when I walk. The pain would be present, but mild when sitting around, and would typically go away if I continue sitting for a prolonged period with short walks in between.

The next morning (today), the pain feels similar, but slightly better. There is no pain on the outside anymore, it's all in the arch, and feels like the stretching pain I mentioned earlier. I did a lot of research and googling, and all I really see is Plantar Fasciitis or Stress Fracture. But my initial thought was that maybe I just overworked it a bit in not great shoes (just got Nike Pegasuses in the mail today, sigh).

I'm going to take a least a week off to see how I feel. I'm just worried that I did some damage that will take a long time to heal.

So my questions are:
* Does this sound like a potential serious injury?

* If the pain subsides in a week, how should I experiment with running again? Should I start slow with something like 1-2 miles and see how it feels? Progressively work my way back up?

* Is it a bad idea to do yoga stretches while the injury is still present?

681,681,681,92,Does new shoes make any difference ?,1601500486,"Hi All,  
I am a average runner, 3 times a week at least with 2x10k and on long run during the weekend around 14-16km.  
I was improving my running form till this month but an injury caused a break of 3 weeks.   
So I started running, I normally run in my Pegasus Turbo or Turbo shield depending on the wether, each has mileage of 300km &amp; 100km.

  
I received my new shoes this week, another pair of Pegasus Turbo and I used them for a run today.  
From the beginning of the run, I felt like not getting enough feedback/energy from the new shoes, I tried to run my fastest 10K and I was doing good till 8km with 4.40 per split but then I couldn't generate same level of  energy so I took 2 min break to breath and completed next 2km with 4.50 splits.  


I felt like I could've done better if I was using my old shoes, the energy return with the new pair is definitely off, I had to put more effort to maintain the pace which led to a break for the first time in a 10K run for me. I did my first half marathon 1 month ago (2hr1min) without a break or even hydration and that too in hot temperature.

If no burn in required, do you think my pair is defective ?  I do feel they are a bit stiff compared to my other 2 old pairs.",running,eagleporter,False,/r/running/comments/j2uvva/does_new_shoes_make_any_difference/

March, boom, pandemic, lockdown, income tanks, stuck at home, oh shit.

Nothing to do, start lifting some weights I had at home, might as well, right?

April, lost like 2 pounds, progress is progress right? The news are all over the place regarding the virus, I'll keep doing my thing.

May, it's now pretty clear that the healthier you are, the better your odds are in case of an infection, oh well, I have a big yard, let's do some cardio, 10 minutes at a time, end up breathless, soaked and coughing.

June: Parks are open, I might as well try to be one of those people and wake up at 6 am to do my cardio, 15 minutes now, torture, can't breathe but I push to keep moving.

July: 20 minutes, oh god I walk so much, this sucks so much, but I just gotta move for 20 minutes.

End of August: 30 minutes now, running for the most of it, still long walks, i do 3-4k on a good day

First week of September: Can run for 30 minutes now at a manageable pace 4.6, holy shit, can I do this??

Second week of september: Alright boys, we'll run at this pace for the verses and sprint at the chorus, wtf? Only 4.3 to 4.5 this week, must be a bad approach.

Third week of september: SOMETHING clicks, can't explain it, I'm in some ZONE, rythm is constant, comfortable, my head is clear, focused, I can feel it, won't look at the fitbit, relax, remember to wait for the 15 minute cue to start pushing your legs and to go faster, 30 minute cue comes up, 4.9.

SHIT.

Last week: I nail it, must've been a one off, but i do it again the next day, then i rest, then again, and again, this week? Head over heels, I'm dominating, 5.2k

Longer post: As time progresses, smartphones are getting bigger and bigger. When I started out running, I went vanilla and used nothing.

In fact, I ran with it for a long, long time, until it eventually failed because the battery pushed its way out of the case.

I bought a couple of belts which are intended to carry your documents or keys, and they work fine for that purpose. But once you load your phone in, the thing just wobbles around and slaps either my back or my jewels, and it hurts bad.

A little background: I’ve been running a good bit this year, I got shin splints for the first time ever about 5 months ago when doing a 4 mile run. (Of course I built up to that point). I took time off to let them heal, probably not enough. I can’t exactly remember how long, I know it wasn’t longer than a month though. Ever since then, I’ve been getting shin splints back to back. I’ve changed my shoes to a better running shoe (Brooks GTS 20) last month was the last I got shin splints, I took a full month off running and the pain is completely gone. 

I’ve decided to start over completely, if that means only running one mile a day, so be it. 

I’m looking into the Garmin coach feature for a beginner training plan. But there’s a few long runs (about 45 minutes) I’m afraid it’ll bring the shin splints right back.. like really afraid. Does anyone have any experience with a really good beginning plan?

Nike air zoom pegasus 37 - heavier well cushioned trainer which I use for all my road runs during the week including my long runs.

Hello all, beginner runner here. I started C25K back in May and made it to where its was run 5/6/5 and I hit a wall. Just couldn't get through it, even after repeating that week 3 times. I could maybe do the first 5 min run, but then only managed about half the remaining running times. My legs just felt heavy and get tired before the rest of me. I didn't run very much in July due to some health issues, but picked up training again in August thanks to my fancy new Garmin Venue. I chose Jeff Galloway as my 5k coach who does the walk run method. Week 1 I could run the half mile ""long run."" Well, I am now on week 9 and I still only manage to run a half mile at a time. I'm getting frustrated because I feel like I'm going no where with my training. There was a bit of hope 2 weeks ago when I managed to run a wholw mile on all 3 of my weekly run (2 on a treadmill, 1 outside). However, now I am back to struggling to do a half mile. 

My training right now consists of 3 runs a week, 2 cadence drills and one long run. Long runs are now up to 2.5 miles. I run outside 90% time, drink water throughout the day, and invested in good shoes (Brooks). Main issue is my legs seems to get tired before the rest of me and arent getting better/building muscle. Yes I run slow, very slow. On a treadmill I usually set it at 4.5 and when I'm outside I usually run around 5 mph. Other details - I'm 30, 5""3' 127 lb F. The last thing that may be of note is I am a type 1 diabetic, have been for 23 years. 

I have a doctors appointment scheduled next week to if they can tell me anything. At the beginning of all this I was working out zero times a week and understand I came into this very out of shape.

29M, not overweight but skinnyfat and definitely not in top condition. My goals are just to get fitter and faster, a 22 minute 5k would be nice.

Before May I was doing zero exercise besides maybe 20 minutes walking to and from the train station twice a day. Then during lockdown I started doing C25k with my wife who runs a fair bit slower than me, in the past month I have started running on my own as well and wanted some input on what I can do.

Currently I run Monday, Wednesday, Friday, one of those will be with my wife, about 40 minutes for 5k, and the others will be on my own, about 27.5 for 5k. Can I just keep doing this and see improvements to get me to my goal?

Our usual route is a round-trip from our house, but as we live right at the top of a hill, whatever we do there's a big hill for the last ~1k of our run, which slows us right down. I recently did a flat 5k round a lake and got 24:40 which I was very pleased with. My question is, am I helping myself with that hill, or not?

With regards to pace, when I am running, I just settle into those paces without thinking about it, I'm not trying to go fast or slow, is this a 'tempo run'? When my mum ran she would always talk about a conversational pace, I don't know what that is since I'm running alone mostly and when I do run with my wife, she is not up for talking as it's quite an effort for her. Is there benefit to running at a slower pace, and do you set it at say 80% of normal pace, do you look at your watch to keep yourself in that zone?

I'm doing my first race in three weeks (12K, surface: compacted dirt, flat), but I have still some questions.

I used to run, but got out of the habit (having babies can do that to you) but now I'd like to take it up again. The problem is that my shoes hurt like hell. I went to a running specialty shoe store where they proclaimed me an over-pronator and insisted I get shoes with lots of support (this happened twice) despite my gut feeling that I need more minimal shoes. When I'm walking, I'm most comfortable in a Keds-style canvas flat with zero arch support and zero rise, so I really should have trusted myself. So now I have two pairs of obnoxious shoes that give me a horrible cramp in the outside of my foot - the ""flexor digiti minimi brevis"" to be specific - and make me run in a way that kills my knees and hips (though to be fair, everything aside from zero gravity makes my knees and hips hurt - having babies can do that to you!).

For me, that's a target HR of 146bpm. My HR before this experiment was usually in the 170 range for ""gentle"" runs, and much higher for tempo runs, so it's quite the changeup.

**Why am I doing this?** I'm giving MAF a 12-week trial on the recommendation of a runner friend (who is *much* better than me). Plus, the glowing reviews of hundreds of folks online. I'll be documenting my experiences here.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE SUMMARY**

...yeah, pretty terrible.

We've reached the end of 12 weeks of MAF training, interspersed by two brief layoffs due to a sore Achilles tendon in my left foot - an injury I've never had before. And the results are... not great. Pretty woeful, truth be told.

After my first lay-off, I started week 9 with three consecutive runs that were my worst during the entire experiment. And by a long way. Each of these runs was 7.60 kilometres, and I ran them in 49:00, 48:30, and 50:30. Yikes. What's more, each of these runs I actually lapsed *over* my target HR of 146. I was up in the 150's for almost that entire week, despite my best efforts to slow down.

I was really disappointed to have lost so much condition after a 13 day hiatus. I had hoped that my previous 400-500 kilometres had been training my cardiovascular system, and that the break might actually do me some good - give my muscles a chance to rest, come back stronger, that kind of thing. As it turns out, definitely not. I really struggled. I honestly felt like I was starting from scratch. My times reflected this.

The next week and a half stabilized at a pace between 6:15 and 6:20... before I hurt my Achilles once more. I was super frustrated, but not wanting to risk it becoming something more debilitating, I took another week off. And once again, I came back in awful shape. My times ballooned outward *again*, my HR was constantly bumping up over 150, and things actually got worse with almost every run until we reached the end of week 12.

In fact, week 12 was my worst week for the entire program.

To put in so many miles for so many weeks and watch yourself deteriorate that badly... ouch.

That hurts.

**THE GOOD**

At this stage, I'm afraid there's not much good left to report. Even the mileage – the big plus from this easy-running philosophy – has taken a bit of a hit due to injuries.

But the fact remains that I've knocked up 662.96 kilometres, or 411.94 miles, in three months.

I'm proud of that.

**THE BAD**

You may have noticed, as I have, that we really saw no tangible improvements over the course of the program. There was a little improvement during month two, but the cold hard fact remains that my fastest week of running was during *the very first week of the program*.

It's kinda baffling seeing such sustained regression.

Just to be sure that what I've been seeing is indeed regression (and not some kind of hidden/masked progress), I've spent the last week or so since I finished the MAF program running a series of gradually faster runs. I was curious to see how 12 weeks of easy running has affected my ability to run at pace. After a week of building up my tempo, I tried an all-out 5km yesterday. And I struggled. My best time before doing this was around 22:30, and I found myself absolutely *gassed* running a 25:15. I was out on my feet for the last kilometer. My HR almost hit 200. For context, before starting this, 25 mins was a relatively straightforward tempo run for me.

So, where did it all go wrong?

Looking back on it, I could actually feel the runs getting harder, not easier, as time went on. I  felt like I was getting *less fit* running at such an easy pace. I wasn't ever pushing myself, straining, trying to run faster... that would just blow my HR past the dreaded 146. As a result, I just kinda meandered, and ultimately even started going backward.

That lack of stimulus – no speed work, no tempo runs, no pace at all – just saw me stagnate. Going into this, I was skeptical about seeing much progress from little-to-no exertion, and I'm disappointed to say that the skepticism was probably accurate. Do I think you need to kill yourself every single run to see improvement? Definitely not. But do I think that running everything at 146HR is ultra-conservative, to a fault? Yes, I do. There was no stimulus, no impetus to drive improvement.

Running 100% MAF for three months didn't make me better at running. It made me better at covering a whole lot of miles with minimum effort, and at increasingly slower paces.

Now I should mention here that I've got no doubt that I've built a solid base after 600+ kms / 400+ miles. I'm 100% certain that my cardiovascular fitness has improved. It *must* have. Those improvements are probably just hidden right now behind a lack of conditioning (I feel like my ""running muscles"" have atrophied at such low speeds) and lack of mental fortitude (I'm just not used to running *hard* anymore). After a few weeks of training at faster paces again, I'm sure I can get back to where I was.

But here's the thing... that base I've built... I'm also 100% certain that I could have built it better, faster, and without losing the ability to run a good 5k time in the process. Any basic training regime which incorporates both easy runs and effort runs would have been a better use of time – at least for me, personally. Even the very rudimentary training programs in the Nike Run Club app saw me improve my 5k time from 26:00 to 22:30 in the space of 12 weeks at the start of this year. And they did it by incorporating speed work, tempo runs and fartleks alongside the slower base work.

**THE UGLY**

Injuries.

My left Achilles has veered into the realm of tendonitis on three separate occasions during this program. Whilst the increase in mileage certainly played a role, I think the greater concern has been the deterioration of my running form. Subconsciously, I've adapted to running so slowly, and not in a good way.

Despite my best efforts, my gait has degraded over this last 12 weeks. Reviewing myself on video, I discovered that I've developed a low, shuffling stride with minimal heel lift, swinging my lower legs out and overextending into a nasty heel strike. And I was mentally monitoring my form the whole time! I thought it was good! What's more, my cadence had dropped horrendously, sometimes as low as 148. And all of this was entirely subconscious.

Running at such low HR, my body just found ways to compensate and maneuver itself into whatever positions required the least effort. You continually make small changes and see them reflected in a lower HR. Those small changes then become part of your stride. And those small changes aren't always good – they're just easier on the heart. Indeed, any attempt to run with ""good form"" just blows the average runner's HR well above 150 bpm.

By way of an experiment, I decided to run as *slowly* as I could with the following caveats: a cadence of approx 170, and a midfoot strike beneath a flexed knee. The slowest pace I could achieve with those rules in place was around 5:35/km. This corresponded to a heart-rate of around 165 bpm. That's what ""good running form"" looks like for me – and I could *never* have hoped to achieve that form at 146HR.

MAF makes running with good technique *very* difficult for us regular folk.

I think there's a real danger in setting an arbitrary HR and asking people to hit it, no matter what. For a lot of us who aren't elite runners, we'll have to make bad compensations to keep our heart-rates in check. For me, that meant a much lower cadence, and a lazy, swinging overstride which has left me with some lingering tendon pain and some nodules on my Achilles.

(My higher HR, ""good form"" runs since the MAF experiment ended have, interestingly, proven pain free.)

**THE VERDICT**

Despite all I've said above, I am truly grateful to MAF for showing me just how slow I can be (and *should* be) running. I've been amazed at how many miles I've put on the shoes. Easy running is something I'll definitely carry forward with me.

But it will be done with good, safe form. And it won't be at a strict 146HR.

In my opinion (and please remember, all of this is just one subjective opinion from one runner), I think that MAF is a bad program for people like me.

My main gripe is that it's too arbitrary in its targets. I think that its HR formula – 180 subtract age, plus a couple of small modifications – is too basic in its approach for the serious runner. Its one-size-fits-all ethos will work for many, but will leave others struggling to meet a HR which is imperfectly calculated for their unique circumstances. The wealth of other programs which determine HR zones based on lactic thresholds/max HR/VO2 Max tests are, definitionally, much more accurate for those who want to be sure they've got the right number.

(And interestingly, many of these more accurate methods seem to calculate my zone two threshold HR between 155 and 160 bpm. Those extra 10-15 beats would have made the world of difference to my training over the last three months.)

And finally, I feel that MAF errs on the side of caution. It's conservative to a fault. I certainly feel like my running suffered without any faster work whatsoever – and my continually poor results would seem to reflect that. Easy running can be great for building a base, but as I've discovered, overly-easy running (and nothing but that) can see you stall out completely.

I should be clear here: I think MAF has some merit. If you're a new runner, it's a fantastic way to start racking up the miles in a low-stress manner. If you're an elite runner, and you can keep decent pace and good form at your MAF heartrate, I'm sure it's a brilliant method to build a huuuuuuge base for longer events. I can definitely see why it has its devotees.

But if you're like me – no longer a newbie who can cash in on beginner gains, but nowhere near elite enough to run good paces at 146HR – I think there are too many pitfalls which make it a bad program.

Easy running is something I'll keep with me forever. But MAF – with its conservative approach and its arbitrarily set, soul-crushingly low heart rate – is something I'm looking forward to leaving behind me.

I'm sorry this couldn't be a more positive update, but I'd like to take the chance to thank all those who've read, commented and encouraged me along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE SUMMARY**

...yeah, pretty terrible.

We've reached the end of 12 weeks of MAF training, interspersed by two brief layoffs due to a sore Achilles tendon in my left foot - an injury I've never had before. And the results are... not great. Pretty woeful, truth be told. 

After my first lay-off, I started week 9 with three consecutive runs that were my worst during the entire experiment. And by a long way. Each of these runs was 7.60 kilometres, and I ran them in 49:00, 48:30, and 50:30. Yikes. What's more, each of these runs I actually lapsed *over* my target HR of 146. I was up in the 150's for almost that entire week, despite my best efforts to slow down.

I was really disappointed to have lost so much condition after a 13 day hiatus. I had hoped that my previous 400-500 kilometres had been training my cardiovascular system, and that the break might actually do me some good - give my muscles a chance to rest, come back stronger, that kind of thing. As it turns out, definitely not. I really struggled. I honestly felt like I was starting from scratch. My times reflected this. 

The next week and a half stabilized at a pace between 6:15 and 6:20... before I hurt my Achilles once more. I was super frustrated, but not wanting to risk it becoming something more debilitating, I took another week off. And once again, I came back in awful shape. My times ballooned outward *again*, my HR was constantly bumping up over 150, and things actually got worse with almost every run until we reached the end of week 12. 

In fact, week 12 was my worst week for the entire program.

To put in so many miles for so many weeks and watch yourself deteriorate that badly... ouch. 

That hurts.

**THE GOOD**

At this stage, I'm afraid there's not much good left to report. Even the mileage – the big plus from this easy-running philosophy – has taken a bit of a hit due to injuries. 

But the fact remains that I've knocked up 662.96 kilometres, or 411.94 miles, in three months.

I'm proud of that.

**THE BAD**

You may have noticed, as I have, that we really saw no tangible improvements over the course of the program. There was a little improvement during month two, but the cold hard fact remains that my fastest week of running was during *the very first week of the program*. 

It's kinda baffling seeing such sustained regression.

Just to be sure that what I've been seeing is indeed regression (and not some kind of hidden/masked progress), I've spent the last week or so since I finished the MAF program running a series of gradually faster runs. I was curious to see how 12 weeks of easy running has affected my ability to run at pace. After a week of building up my tempo, I tried an all-out 5km yesterday. And I struggled. My best time before doing this was around 22:30, and I found myself absolutely *gassed* running a 25:15. I was out on my feet for the last kilometer. My HR almost hit 200. For context, before starting this, 25 mins was a relatively straightforward tempo run for me. 

So, where did it all go wrong?

Looking back on it, I could actually feel the runs getting harder, not easier, as time went on. I  felt like I was getting *less fit* running at such an easy pace. I wasn't ever pushing myself, straining, trying to run faster... that would just blow my HR past the dreaded 146. As a result, I just kinda meandered, and ultimately even started going backward. 

That lack of stimulus – no speed work, no tempo runs, no pace at all – just saw me stagnate. Going into this, I was skeptical about seeing much progress from little-to-no exertion, and I'm disappointed to say that the skepticism was probably accurate. Do I think you need to kill yourself every single run to see improvement? Definitely not. But do I think that running everything at 146HR is ultra-conservative, to a fault? Yes, I do. There was no stimulus, no impetus to drive improvement. 

Running 100% MAF for three months didn't make me better at running. It made me better at covering a whole lot of miles with minimum effort, and at increasingly slower paces.

Now I should mention here that I've got no doubt that I've built a solid base after 600+ kms / 400+ miles. I'm 100% certain that my cardiovascular fitness has improved. It *must* have. Those improvements are probably just hidden right now behind a lack of conditioning (I feel like my ""running muscles"" have atrophied at such low speeds) and lack of mental fortitude (I'm just not used to running *hard* anymore). After a few weeks of training at faster paces again, I'm sure I can get back to where I was.

But here's the thing... that base I've built... I'm also 100% certain that I could have built it better, faster, and without losing the ability to run a good 5k time in the process. Any basic training regime which incorporates both easy runs and effort runs would have been a better use of time – at least for me, personally. Even the very rudimentary training programs in the Nike Run Club app saw me improve my 5k time from 26:00 to 22:30 in the space of 12 weeks at the start of this year. And they did it by incorporating speed work, tempo runs and fartleks alongside the slower base work. 

**THE UGLY**

Injuries. 

My left Achilles has veered into the realm of tendonitis on three separate occasions during this program. Whilst the increase in mileage certainly played a role, I think the greater concern has been the deterioration of my running form. Subconsciously, I've adapted to running so slowly, and not in a good way.

Despite my best efforts, my gait has degraded over this last 12 weeks. Reviewing myself on video, I discovered that I've developed a low, shuffling stride with minimal heel lift, swinging my lower legs out and overextending into a nasty heel strike. And I was mentally monitoring my form the whole time! I thought it was good! What's more, my cadence had dropped horrendously, sometimes as low as 148. And all of this was entirely subconscious. 

Running at such low HR, my body just found ways to compensate and maneuver itself into whatever positions required the least effort. You continually make small changes and see them reflected in a lower HR. Those small changes then become part of your stride. And those small changes aren't always good – they're just easier on the heart. Indeed, any attempt to run with ""good form"" just blows the average runner's HR well above 150 bpm. 

By way of an experiment, I decided to run as *slowly* as I could with the following caveats: a cadence of approx 170, and a midfoot strike beneath a flexed knee. The slowest pace I could achieve with those rules in place was around 5:35/km. This corresponded to a heart-rate of around 165 bpm. That's what ""good running form"" looks like for me – and I could *never* have hoped to achieve that form at 146HR. 

MAF makes running with good technique *very* difficult for us regular folk. 

I think there's a real danger in setting an arbitrary HR and asking people to hit it, no matter what. For a lot of us who aren't elite runners, we'll have to make bad compensations to keep our heart-rates in check. For me, that meant a much lower cadence, and a lazy, swinging overstride which has left me with some lingering tendon pain and some nodules on my Achilles. 

(My higher HR, ""good form"" runs since the MAF experiment ended have, interestingly, proven pain free.)

**THE VERDICT**

Despite all I've said above, I am truly grateful to MAF for showing me just how slow I can be (and *should* be) running. I've been amazed at how many miles I've put on the shoes. Easy running is something I'll definitely carry forward with me. 

But it will be done with good, safe form. And it won't be at a strict 146HR.

In my opinion (and please remember, all of this is just one subjective opinion from one runner), I think that MAF is a bad program for people like me.

My main gripe is that it's too arbitrary in its targets. I think that its HR formula – 180 subtract age, plus a couple of small modifications – is too basic in its approach for the serious runner. Its one-size-fits-all ethos will work for many, but will leave others struggling to meet a HR which is imperfectly calculated for their unique circumstances. The wealth of other programs which determine HR zones based on lactic thresholds/max HR/VO2 Max tests are, definitionally, much more accurate for those who want to be sure they've got the right number. 

(And interestingly, many of these more accurate methods seem to calculate my zone two threshold HR between 155 and 160 bpm. Those extra 10-15 beats would have made the world of difference to my training over the last three months.)

And finally, I feel that MAF errs on the side of caution. It's conservative to a fault. I certainly feel like my running suffered without any faster work whatsoever – and my continually poor results would seem to reflect that. Easy running can be great for building a base, but as I've discovered, overly-easy running (and nothing but that) can see you stall out completely. 

I should be clear here: I think MAF has some merit. If you're a new runner, it's a fantastic way to start racking up the miles in a low-stress manner. If you're an elite runner, and you can keep decent pace and good form at your MAF heartrate, I'm sure it's a brilliant method to build a huuuuuuge base for longer events. I can definitely see why it has its devotees.

But if you're like me – no longer a newbie who can cash in on beginner gains, but nowhere near elite enough to run good paces at 146HR – I think there are too many pitfalls which make it a bad program. 

Easy running is something I'll keep with me forever. But MAF – with its conservative approach and its arbitrarily set, soul-crushingly low heart rate – is something I'm looking forward to leaving behind me.

I'm sorry this couldn't be a more positive update, but I'd like to take the chance to thank all those who've read, commented and encouraged me along the way.

I started running in March, and it quickly became apparent that I had to breathe through my mouth. At first this was out of necessity; I was unfit and could barely complete the c25k runs. 

As my running progressed, my breathing stayed the same. I would go out in the mornings, and my nose would be blocked; breathing through it was impossible. It was winter here in Aus, so I thought my nose must be sensitive to the cold. I read here on r/running about clearing your nose... I tried my best to clear my nose during a run but nothing could come out or in. Despite occasionally feeling like I could breathe through my nose, I now know that those breaths I took were shallow and could never fill my lungs properly. 

Eventually I chalked it down to general unfitness as I've never been the most fit woman on the planet. I count Koalas and Sloths as the animals I relate to most. I was running consistently about 5k a day, 3-4 times a week. I continued mouth-breathing as I ran, laughing at my boyfriend's tips to try to get me to breathe more ""like a runner"". Once I glared at him, imitated his breath and he could hear the air ripping through my nose like a snore; he gave up trying to teach me how to breathe after that. 

Then I finally hit a wall. I couldn't run more than 2k, I was slower than ever. I went to a doctor, who told me that I had sinsitus and I needed a nasal drip. He said waking up with a sore throat and blocked nose everyday were classic symptoms - symptoms I've had for around a year at least. 

I just did the first nasal drip today and... oh my god. THIS is breathing! My nose hasn't even completely unblocked yet and I feel like I just unlocked a whole new level of air! 

How the hell did I stick with running this whole time...? I guess I fell in love with it despite the discomfort. I'm going to rest for a bit now to try and get fully better, but I am excited and hopeful about my next run.

Hello everyone

I used to run for fun when I was younger but as I got older and busy with work and relationships I pared it down to a single 5K yearly or occasionally nothing.

A few years ago after having high blood-sugar, high cholesterol and being overweight, I reluctantly started running again. Firstly with a weekly Parkrun which is 5K and after 6 months I stepped up to run a couple of times a week. Now after 18 months my blood-sugar, cholesterol and weight are all normalized and I’m up to doing 9K three times a week.

When I got back this morning, I began to reflect on things whilst having my breakfast and concluded that I didn’t really enjoy running! It’s definitely helped sort out my health but other than that I can’t think of one single thing I enjoy about it. I don’t seem to get a runners high, I hate going to bed early and getting up early, I hate that slightly tired feeling, and I hate the way that I’ve had to stop smoking and cut down on my drinking!

\[This page\]([http://www.outsideinteractive.com/fitness-equipment-manufacturers/](http://www.outsideinteractive.com/fitness-equipment-manufacturers/)) lists a few but the Life Fitness and Woodway treadmills are all over $2K (USD) but it's not mentioned if they support BLE FTMS or just a custom BLE service that happens to allow controlling messages. The \[NoblePro Elite E8i\]([https://www.noble-pro.com/elite-e8i-treadmill/](https://www.noble-pro.com/elite-e8i-treadmill/)) explicitly supports FTMS and is below $2K but getting them to ship to and provide warranty support for a treadmill in the United States is an open question.

Additional context: unlike bike trainers, it's hard to find treadmills that explicitly support the sending of controlling messages to the device over FTMS let alone ANT+ FE-C. For treadmills this is primarily to control speed and incline in addition to reading them and doing so over Bluetooth is more compatible with tablets/phones to avoid having to translate to ANT+.

Played soccer my whole life, so I’m used to conditioning and running hard. 

Two years ago I had a harsh increase in daily anxiety and had somatic symptoms because of it. Some of these include shortness of breath and tingling sensations whenever I’d push myself in working out. Shortness of breath has always been a constant issue,  regardless of the intensity of working out, if any.

I went for a run today to clear my mind and now am uncontrollably coughing. I’ve had this issue before, but assumed it was because of cold weather. It’s 75 in Dallas right now so I really don’t think it’s that. I don’t think this is COVID-related either, but I could be wrong. 

I’d like to say I’ve been running for my whole life, since I’m a soccer player but I can’t really say I was a seriously competitive runner. I ran XC in middle school but wasn’t that great since I’m a better sprinter. My average mile pace is often below 7, but my fastest all time mile is around 5:15 which I ran over the summer. 

Because I’m in my best personal shape right now, I’m a little confused why I’ve been coughing so much after this run. It totally came out of the blue and it was hard to breathe. My legs and hands were tingly and it felt like my extremities fell asleep on me.

I'm 56, recently lost 70 lbs and new to running as a hobby. Additionally, I've never been a runner because I've been overweight most of my life. Something clicked, I lost the weight and now I like to run. I just need to give my question some context. 

But because I just started running I probably increased my mileage faster than I should have. As a result, I'm absolutely exhausted. I also don't know what I'm supposed to feel. So far, it's been pretty good, so much that I just increase mileage. I'm up to 10 miles now. Last year I couldn't run .25 miles. 

Anyway... A question or experienced runners... Are there days where you feel like you can seemingly run forever? And then days when you can barely finish a mile? It's not so much that anything hurts, you simply don't feel like it and just start walking... That happened to me yesterday and it hasn't happened before. I should add that the previous day I did a 7.5 mile trail run and ran most of the way up a 900' peak--I think I stopped three times to hike and then kept going.

I set out on a five mile run just to cap the day and my leg muscles seemingly just stopped! (no other way to describe it). There wan no pain, I wasn't short of breath--I simply didn't want to run anymore. I walked back and would jog occasionally. So, is this overtraining? Something that just happens? Something more personal and it's not supposed to happen? Any ideas?

I ran my first 10k following the novice Hal Higdon program in the middle of July and just ran a half marathon at the beginning of September.  

Recently a week ago on a long run I started to develop some light groin area muscle pain in my thigh and didn't think much of it. After a day of rest I ran again and it didn't get much better but I could finish my usual medium 5mi run. I've tried to stay on schedule but reduce my distance and the pain has continued and subsided but just returned after my long run again this week. 

I usually run 5 days a week with rest alternating a day before and after a long run. I'm worried about taking more than a few days break because running has now become an integral part of my life and something I can't imaging going without. I'd love to hear some advice on what I should do!

Running has transformed my life!  I’m happier, healthier, lost weight... I just love being out there running! 

As a novice with low fitness levels and a habit of being a bit extreme when starting something new (and I’m 43 years young) it’s no surprise I’ve now experienced my first injury....a groin strain of all things.

Whilst the pain has reduced (it’s been two weeks) I still can’t run.  I’m doing some exercises and I wondered if these are delaying the healing processes....

I walk my dog every day (normally 1.5 miles)
Use an elliptical machine for 30 minutes 3 times a week
Bike ride with my son (7 miles ish) once a week, he’s 10 so it’s a steady pace and quite a flat route
And have been foam rolling my legs every morning and evening (a friend said this would help, not sure it does) 

I want to keep my fitness levels up.  But is all this too much?  

Are all or some of these exercises wrong for a groin strains.

I started doing trail running about 2 years ago, this was going to be the year where I would start with Ultras but everything is cancelled here (Argentina).

During that time, I tried several shoes but without any luck, they all start to tear in the upper sides around the 200 miles mark. You can see a gallery of all my shoes here:

https://imgur.com/a/9fBT3Jt

At first I thought it was a Salomon thing, so I moved to Altra but those lasted even less.

Sadly, here in Argentina I can only get Salomon at a reasonable price, every other shoe is imported and because we had several devaluations recently, the price for a Hoka (for example) would round the 200usd, when I can get a Salomon S-Lab for half that.

My question is:

Should I start taking care of the shoes on some way?

Should I stop expecting my trail running shoes to last the same as my road shoes?

Should I try a different brand?

My idea right now is to stick to Salomon, because I can get 2 pairs for the price of one of other brand, and maybe having a rotation would mean that they last longer. And also, of all the shoes I tried, in terms of performance and feel, Salomon were the best ones.

I'm a 40 year old male, reasonably fit, my primary sport is mountain biking (it was BJJ until this coronavius thing).

However, I want to be able to run - as it's a great workout in a short amoutn of time that you can do anywhere with minimal equipment. Also, long term I want to get into trail-running (maybe do a 10 - 16 km trail running race in 6 - 9 months time).

I started out the last 3 weeks just running 3 - 5 km (pacing myself so that I could finish but pretty much as fast as I could).

The first 2 weeks I did \~9km total (2 runs)

Last week I did \~14km total (3 runs).

I ran a sub 25 min 5k last week.

However I have some knee pain on the outside of my left knee this weekend - so I started reading about running training.

Now I'm super confused.

Did I start doing too much?

Also, all my runs seem to be VO2 max (or tempo runs), when I should be doing tempo, easy, long?

Is this necessary? I'm currently just running for fitness and to build some endurance.

But I 100% do not want to get injured. Should I be backing off?

Or following a training plan aimed at beginners (which seems to use much lower distances and walking etc.) - I think I'm better than that, or is that just my ego and maybe for the sake of my body I need to start that slow?

It was VERY bad at first. Like radiate through both of my feet and knock me off my feet at its worst. Mostly in the ball of foot and arch area. Three months later, it's a bit better but still bothering me quite a bit. 

The pain is the worst when I wake up, when driving, and when I'm laying down on my bed. There's a spot in my left foot kind of on my fourth toe that gets this deep sharp pain. It's always in the same spot and it's the most intense. What's REALLY weird to me is that when I'm up and walking, working out, running, etc. it usually goes away completely.

I am about to start running and want to get some advice to prevent injuries. When I have tried running in the past, I have usually developed a sore knee and have to stop for a week or more before it comes right. Obviously this is a massive demotivation, hence I haven't really run for more than 3 week stretches before. People say you shouldn't fight through knee pain so I don't.

Any thoughts on why I get this pain and how to prevent it would be appreciated. I think it might be related to my IT band, as there is usually pain in my hip also.

I am generally in good health, but have an average amount of fat (within healthy BMI range). The main problem I have is my posture. I have anterior pelvic tilt, which may stem from/be the cause of kyphosis and knock knee.

979,979,979,99,Moving Forward from a Slow Half Marathon,1601261316,"Hey all!

I ran my third half marathon (23, F) this weekend alone because my race was cancelled.  I didn’t mind because it was a nice day and I live near a park with a loop I could do a couple times. I was expecting to pull a solid time but ended up running almost 10 minutes slower than usual. Here is some background on my times:

September 2019 2:06 (race)
April 2020 ~2:07 (virtual race)
September 2020 2:15 (virtual race)

Before, my first half I had just graduated college and finished my nearly 14 year swimming career only a few months prior and decided to transition to running.  I chalked up my slower second half to weird circumstances of COVID times.  I also did not take my taper as seriously that go around.  In fact I was recall taking a five mile walk and drinking a hard seltzer the day before (yikes!) This go around I have lost almost 10 pounds since April, took my taper more seriously, and felt more mentally prepared. So I’m miffed as to why I did so poorly.

I have gone between Hal Higdon’s intermediate plan and the Nike Running club plans.  I like Hal’s focus on getting in the mileage but prefer a slightly longer taper than 1 week.  And I felt like my Nike plan didn’t get me enough mileage this time and my taper was too long. So I acknowledge my plan may be partly the culprit.  I also was limited to home-based HIIT cross training as my local pool and gym were closed for COVID and my area is a little too urban for biking and I don’t have a car:(

All in all, I want to run faster for my next race in May. I hope it is in person and I imagine the adrenaline of a race will help but what else can I do? I sometimes worry my first half time was credited to some residual fitness from swimming. I am also still learning about the sport of running so I am not sure if this ebb in performance uncommon.

You see, I'm quite a stats nerd. I like seeing measureable progress in the things I do. So I would bring my phone with me and record everything with an app. My time, my pace, my distance. I would check it often. It was a huge distraction.

Eventually, I'd get discouraged, and stop running. Because the internal pressure of wanting to progress my stats became too much (dumb, I know).

So the most recent time I've tried picking it up, I left the phone at home. Maybe I'll go to Google maps before hand and measure out a reasonable route, but I don't time myself anymore. I don't try to run faster than last time, every time, anymore. It takes the pressure off.

What works for me is to time myself once a month. That's what I do now, and it works a lot. I'll always see at least some progress, since I've had a lot more time between measurements.

TLDR; run trackers and watches are a great way to measure your progress, but it might be worth leaving them at home (especially as a beginner).

991,991,991,12,Does anyone else have “big” feet?,1601253692,"This is more a rant for anyone who has big feet and knows the frustrations of shoe shopping for runners. 

So it’s that time of year where I need new shoes. Not going to lie, my current pair were cheap replacements for my older pair. It’s like I’ve been on a spare tire the last year (whole other story). 

However, I HATE buying new running shoes because of the complexities behind it. (Gait, heel drop, width, pronation). The kicker is, I’m a size 15 (USA, I’m also 6’4) for running shoes so at most places my selections are limited. There is a running store in my town but they make me super self conscious about my feet because of how little they can offer me (also, not the best customer service, they’re pretty pretentious). Every time I go there, they can only show me 1 pair and then look at me, assuming I’ll buy it since it’s the only option. I always try to order online, but they’ve literally told me in the past “good luck, there isn’t much else out there.” 

I understand my feet are big and it’s frustrating when options and styles become so limited the bigger the feet. I try to shop online but because there’s so many factors that go into shoes I’m afraid to commit (also money).  I’ve never bought a pair from that shop because I try to take my numbers and find a pair online, but I’m afraid I’m ordering the wrong shoes and I should just get the ones in the store (even if I don’t like them). I’m not trying to be picky but I also want a shoe I like; should I not care what they look like and just be grateful there’s even shoes that fit my giant gorilla feet????????? 

I also hate feeling like I’m incompetent and can’t buy for myself. My last few pairs weren’t spot on, partly cause I was learning about the “art” of running. I started running in 2017 and even on this thread I learn new things every day. I’m also way more active now than in 2017 so my body has changed and therefore my shoes have to change! Trying to explain this to family members who aren’t runners can be frustrating. They think literally one shoe fits all for all runners and how dumb am I for making mistakes when I buy a pair that isn’t spot on (or, maybe it was good for my 2017 but not for my 2018 self, and my 2020 self is different from my 2018 self!). 

Anyways, I recently got my first career job after finishing grad school and my first paycheck is due to come on Wednesday. I figured now is a good time to get a new pair of shoes as a little gift to myself for finishing school and getting a job in the middle of a pandemic. but I hate how self conscious I feel whenever I buy shoes! It takes the fun out of it. I don’t want the wrong shoe and I want a pair that will last me not only in time but in the distance I run (I do around 15 miles a week, so around 4 5K’s and then a long run as a Friday treat, my long runs are around 4-5 miles but I’m hoping to increase them now that I’m in a stable place).  

I have a zoom consult with that running shop on Wednesday so they can (finally) give me some numbers and evaluate my feet for where my feet are at this point in my life (I’m 25M). Thankfully it’s on zoom so I’m hoping i can just tell them the shoes that I want once I’ve been evaluated and they can just order them for store pick up. Then I can go and try them on and pay without any side eye about how big my feet are. I need the consult because I want to know what my feet are for pronation, gait, and all that jazz. Once I have that info I’m hoping I can just start shopping online in the future and not have to deal with them as much. 

I was looking at Altra and ASICS because they were recommended by friends who are runners and I found two pairs I like. they’re my size and width and there’s two pairs for over and under and neutral pronation.  I’m hoping it’ll be a lot more enjoyable and I’ll find a pair I love, but I just wanted to rant to a community that understands. Even my running friends or family who are runners don’t get it cause they have “normal” feet. 

Anyone else understand? How do you handle snobby running store employees? Or people who think you’re doing running “wrong” and you don’t know what you’re doing? Even though they aren’t runners themselves? How do you handle unwanted criticism that makes you feel bad about your body? How do I love my feet? Literally, I cannot change how big my feet are!

1003,1003,1003,25,Frustrated and Needed to Vent to People who Get It,1601249464,"26F - Lately I’ve been hit with several issues that have kept me from running. I initially tore my glutes when I slipped in the last mile of a 15 mile hike over 4th of July week that tabled my running for about a month. Since then, my pulmonologist switched my maintenance inhaler (I have severe asthma, and I have been dealing with it for 20 years.), and I couldn’t breathe at rest, much less run.

For the asthma, I recently learned about the copay program for a biologic injection that I’ve needed for years, so I could FINALLY afford the medication. I started the injection, and I was able to breathe well at all hours during all activities for the first time in my working memory. BUT my steroid inhaler keeps giving me fungal infections on my vocal cords. I’ve been on fluconazole for disseminated fungal infections at least 8 times in the last year. My pulmonologist switched me from a steroid inhaler to a prodrug inhaler, and the new inhaler did absolutely NOTHING for my breathing. I switched myself back to the other just to be able to breathe at rest.

So now I’ve been set back 3.5 months of training, and I’m so out of shape. I recently switched jobs that has me working 9-5 (which slays me, but I love the job). I’m absolutely a morning person and much prefer working 6:30-2:30 or 7-3. Because I don’t run after dark for safety reasons, and I’ve been struggling with the asthma issues lately, I’ve been lucky if I get in 2 runs a week lately. I’ve put on about 10 pounds, and my motivation has gone to sh*t. 

So now I’m facing the “I don’t want to run because I’m out of shape, so it’s not fun right. now-but if I don’t run, I’ll never get back into shape” paradox. I hate the way I look. I hate the way I feel. I hate the loss of muscle definition. And the current disseminated fungal infection means I literally can sleep all day and still feel exhausted AND I have 0 appetite.

I was a Division I ACC scholarship college athlete, and I’ve rarely struggled with motivation. But after two years of medical school, battling depression, anxiety, OCD, an insidious case of nepotism, the current battle to breathe (after beginning the biologic injections and thinking I’d never have a breathing issue again), and now feeling like I have to choose between sacrificing my lungs or sacrificing my liver and kidneys, I feel like my motivation to workout is lost forever.

So I did what I’ve learned helps most on days like this, and I pulled myself up by my boots straps and pounded out a short 2 mile hills run (We live in the mountains.). But I really needed to get this off my chest.

I tried venting to my husband who is absolutely amazing 99% of the time, but he missed the mark on support today 😂

Ive been running for over a month now and I just ran my first sub 8 minute mile. The thing is, I'm not even sure how it happened because it felt relatively effortless and I wasn't really trying at all and thought I was going at a light jogging pace.

Earlier in the day I ran 4x 400m runs under 2 minutes (1:50 average lap time) and I was VERY winded after each run. I've been doing these every other day for about a week now.

I was so exhausted in fact that I decided to call it quits for the day after but not before doing a leisurely mile around the track. Although I felt I was going at a light pace my cadence was definitely accelerated so I deliberately slowed down so I wouldn't tire myself out. Fast forward to my last lap and I finish with a time of 7:47.

I'm using a mi band fitness tracker and it's been pretty accurate so far. I'm just so puzzled as to how it happened because running at that pace earlier was exhausting going all out just doing a single lap but then I manage 4 laps running with minimal effort to completing my first sub 8 minute mile.

1010,1010,1010,33,The inaugural Three Towers Half Marathon,1601242201,"A race I invented recently and ran today. No one else was invited, so it wasn't technically a race except against myself. But they're often the best races.      
There are three water towers around my town and a loop of the three works out as a half marathon.         
So today I decided to have a crack at a sub two hour time.      
Not an easy proposition on a run that takes in three Towers on separate hills. An overall elevation gain of 216m (or 527').     
It starts going along by the river and then through town. The delightful denizens seem to have a problem sticking to their Covid lanes, even though they're painted on the floor, so a bit of traffic avoidance needed. I also knew I'd need to be ahead of target as I hit the first hill (because it just gets tougher from there).         
All was going well as I left town and began my first ascent.          
I got up to the first tower still ahead of target pace and headed down the other side of the hill.            
At the bottom of the hill I went past the training ground for Luton Town Football Club. The were a few fans on the pavement looking through the fence for a glimpse of the players but luckily it's a no through road that leads to a footpath so I could run in the road quite happily.         
As I moved in to the footpath I encountered the headwind from hell. It was a windy day but I'd been going parallel to the direction of the wind to that point and hadn't really been affected.         
The headwind stayed with me until I got to the bottom of hill number two. This is the one with a warning sign telling you it's an 11% gradient...           
Some sweating and swearing later I got to the second tower.  The route then drops a short distance before going back up to the same elevation as the tower.         
A nice bit of downhill to follow and then we start back uphill to tower three.          
I'm not sure if it's because it's the third hill, or if it's because it is a more gradual incline, but it is the hardest of the hills. Really sapping the speed from my legs.         
Still, I was on target as I passed the third tower.       
Great. Now I'm going back downhill.         
But I've picked up the headwind again.      
My average pace is around 9:02 per mile, so still holding good.       
Then, disaster. I got lost.       
Ended up doing a loop through some woods where the ground was pretty soft (except where the tree roots were) and my average pace backed out to 9:20.      
At this point I'm in mile 12.  I've got to get my pace down to 9:09 in the last mile and a half.        
Unfortunately my route was slightly uphill for that whole distance.         
Nothing else for it, I ignored the pain in my feet and legs and upped my cadence to bring my pace up to 8:30 - 8:45.       
Glanced at my watch a couple of times. Surely I was nearly there? Why hadn't it buzzed for 13 miles yet? 12.86 miles? Quarter of a mile to go...          
My watch buzzed.        
0.1 miles to go. 176 yards.          
Done.      
Check the time.

1014,1014,1014,37,"UPDATE to [I've plateaued at 20 miles] and also a ""race"" report.",1601240828,"A bunch of people gave me really excellent advice in a post I made a month ago, which can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ifbv1n/ive\_plateaued\_at\_20\_mile\_runs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ifbv1n/ive_plateaued_at_20_mile_runs/)

Basically, I'm only running one day a week because life and I have a sensitive stomach + plus insulin resistance so not only am I unable to eat enough before/during a run but I also don't carbo-load with any sort of regularity because I'm at high risk of developing diabetes if I don't watch my carbohydrate intake. I was running 20 miles just about every Sunday in San Antonio, TX for the past three months. I was waking up at 4am to beat the heat and running at 13min/mile conversation pace with no walking and couldn't seem to run beyond 20 miles.

Some people pointed out that my ""training"" is inadequate, which they're absolutely right. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to stick to anything that remedies this yet.

Some people recommended Tailwind and Skratch Labs products - I tried both and while I prefer the taste of Skratch Labs, Tailwind seems to do more for my performance.

Another person also recommended I take walk breaks, so I started implementing those every 5 miles after the first 10 miles.

Long story longer, I finally broke 20 miles. The first week I started experimenting with the new nutritional drink powders and walk breaks, I did 22 miles. The following week, I did 24 miles. I took a rest week with no long run and did some sprint work on my lunch breaks + a hike on my normal run day. Then today, I ran 26.26 miles.

I woke up at 3:50am, drank a bottle of Tailwind - got to the trail around 4:30am, began the run at 4:40am. Temperatures were slightly lower then normal, I think I was about 72 degrees F at 4:40am but it was incredibly humid/sticky. Fortunately it was overcast the entire run so even though it was humid and temperatures rose to about 85 degrees F by the time I finished the run, I didn't feel hot like I normally do when I'm running for 2-3 hours in the heat, humidity, AND sun.

First 11 miles, I was averaging about 11.30 min/mile. 

Took a .25 mile walk break while I drank another bottle of Tailwind.

Next 6 miles, I averaged a 12 min/mile pace. At mile 17, I took a .5 mile walk break and drank 1/2 of another bottle of tailwind.

I continued with a 12min/mile pace for the next 5 miles. I stopped at mile 22 to drink the other 1/2 of the Tailwind bottle and take a walk break.

I had hit a wall, I wanted to be done and I could feel myself getting very irritable with my husband because he was insisting I finished the 4.26 miles back to the car (he rides his bike behind me for safety and is a HUGE trooper for waking up at 4am every Sunday with me!).

I grumpily walked for a mile and began running again at mile 23.

I ran the last 3.26 miles averaging 12.30 minutes/mile. In the last .26 miles, I was trying very hard to ""finish strong"" by picking up my speed and was struggling very hard to maintain a 10.15 min/mile pace for the last .26. I was toast.

Whole thing took me 5 hours 52 minutes and 28 seconds. With the walking included, I averaged a 13.26 min/mile pace for the entire 26.26 miles.

While it was overall 26 seconds/mile over my previous normal pace, I shaved an average of a full minute/mile off my actual running time, I was able to complete a marathon, and while I did hit a wall at mile 22 I was able to comfortably go past mile 20.

I definitely still have some more experimenting to do on the nutrition front but I'm pleased with my progress given my complete lack of any kind of training plan. Once I have the nutrition figured out and my life is a little less crazy (I graduate from grad school August 2021 and we \*may\* be done renovating our house by then too, renovations are extra slow when you both work full time and you're DIYing literally everything), I foresee lots of PRs and maybe some ultras in my future.

1016,1016,1016,39,[OC] How high foot arches and foot position can limit running mechanics - What to do about it,1601238995,"Previously we have covered [low/pronated arches](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedPosture/comments/gthu77/pronated_flat_feet_a_deep_dive_guide/) in a previous deep dive guide, but now it's time to give [high arches](https://i1.wp.com/www.2ft.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/carousel-high-arch-02.png?fit=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1) the attention they deserve.

As with anything in the human body, it's all connected and the feet are a result of both the body's interaction with the ground and what is going on up the chain in the pelvis.

I will cover:

- How high arches develop
- Consequences of high arches
- Common symptoms &amp; pain
- What can be done to help restore full foot function

**Tl;dr:** High arches prevent the arch from dropping and lowering into the ground in walking/running. This causes a lack of ""yielding"" into the ground which can result in many compensations. In order to address this, we should re-teach the missing link: Pronation and also likely internal rotation.

**How High Arches Develop:**

The official diagnosis for abnoramlly high foot arches is [Pes Cavus](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pes_cavus). It is an excessively high medial longitudional arch that is often a result of a tibia that is more externally rotated.

The femur will follow the pelvis. If the pelvis is in an anteriorly-tipped orientation, [the femurs will be in internal rotation](https://inspire-fitness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Effects-of-Anterior-Pelvic-Tilt-300x248.jpg). If the pelvis is in a posteriorly-tipped orientation, [the femurs will be in external rotation.](https://rontherapist.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_1412.jpg)

If the femur is internally rotated, in an attempt to find stability, the tibia can turn away from it. [The presentation of tibial external rotation on a relatively internally rotated femur](https://imgur.com/a/01Ytxgo) is often what causes knee valgus, or inwardly collapsing knees.

This type of arch usually develops early in childhood or later in life as a result of a limitation in the lower body ([Neumann, 2016](https://www.amazon.com/Kinesiology-Musculoskeletal-System-Foundations-Rehabilitation/dp/0323287530)).

**Consequences of Pes Cavus**

The most glaring problem with high arches is that it will be limited in its ability to pronate. 

As we strike the ground with our [lateral heel](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0909%2F6780%2Ffiles%2FGait_Analysis_d7fe4811-0b7a-4feb-836f-b349d9f576ea.jpg%3Fv%3D1519541487&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mass4d.com%2Fblogs%2Fclinicians-blog%2Fwhat-to-look-for-in-gait-analysis&amp;tbnid=Xe625dxDeSdPbM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwiNjLGu24fsAhU4GjQIHVeCBpgQMygCegUIARDHAQ..i&amp;docid=30xPEapxTd128M&amp;w=1200&amp;h=628&amp;q=foot%20in%20gait&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNjLGu24fsAhU4GjQIHVeCBpgQMygCegUIARDHAQ), the foot is in a more supinated and rigid state. [When we enter mid-stance phase of gait](https://o.quizlet.com/vFLw-4mlSI35-Yix14exyg.jpg), the arch needs to [drop and lower](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0909/6780/files/Gait_Analysis.jpg?v=1479097259) into the ground so that bodyweight may be appropriately placed over the stance-side foot. This is a ""yielding"" action in which the arch eccentrically legthens and allows for the [Windlass Mechanism](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/d2/4e/bbd24eb4f3a960438c3d1a496c8b429f.jpg) to take place, where the arch then springs back up upon late stance in gait to allow for optimal propulsion.

A person with Pes Cavus will have trouble absorbing the repeated impacts of higher intensity activity like running (Wittungham et. al, 2001; [Dorsey et. al, 2001](http://people.umass.edu/~jhamill/PDF/Williams,%20McClay%20&amp;%20Hamill,%202001.pdf)). This can lead to poor pressure distribution throughout the lower body and stress-related injury.

Because of these limtations, there is little ability to compensate with more of the forefoot because the foot is simply too rigid. The individual is overloading the lateral border of their foot and could be at higher risk for a lateral ankle sprain.

Considering the overall majority of all ankle sprains occur in lateral ankle ligaments ([Doherty et. al, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24105612/)) at the [Anterior Tibiofibular, Calcaneofibular, and Anterior Fibular ligaments,](https://www.healthguideline.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ankle-sprain-pictures-e1568965481144.jpg) this is of particular conern.

We also often see these people with [outwardly pointed feet](https://posturedirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tibial-external-torsion.jpg). This is often an attempt for them to help find the inside edge of their foot for pronation.

**Common Symptoms &amp; Pain signs:**

- Pain under the lateral toes
- Lower limb stress fractures
- [Ilitibibial Band Friction Syndrome](https://www.medicinenet.com/iliotibial_band_syndrome/article.htm)
- Back pain ([Builder &amp; Marr, 1980](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6445916/))
- Foot calluses under the big toe or ""pinkie toe""/5th ray

**What Can Be Done**

[1. Regain Pronation](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDHgJ1qnIR0/)

In order to help this postural condition, it is important for the individual to regain a sense of pronation.

To do this, we can have them put a towel under their arch and dorsiflex their ankle, which is associated with mid-stance phase of gait.

[2. Release the Calves](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE2pyUynfrG/)

We can consider releasing the role of the calves. Because supinated is paired usually with plantar flexion (that's what the calves do), they're often quite tight in these people. 

Releasing the calves will allow them to let go and allow for more pronation/dorsiflexion upon mid-stance.

[3. Re-acquire Internal Rotation via Activating Adductors](https://youtu.be/GQ57pLICguY)

Those are more ""local"" fixes, but we should also look up the kinetic chain for a comprehensive approach. If we have determined a lack of internal rotation at the femur &amp; pelvis is present (usually requires a thorough assessment), we can have the individual activate their adductors to allow for them to re-acquire more internal rotation.

[4. Rear-Foot Elevated Split Squats with Ipsilateral Load](https://youtu.be/QcJFGlgwjDM)

As for exercises that incorporate both the pelvis, legs, and feet, I am a big proponent of rear-foot elevated split squats with a same-side load. The reason for this is balance.
In order to not ""fall"" out to the side, the individual will need to shift their weight to their inner foot and pronate more. This is a more advanced progress I would wait to use until they are ready.

1025,1025,1025,49,Getting chased by dogs on my runs. What do you do,1601233625," I really appreciate pushing my body further the limits... but sprinting half a kilometer after 10km into your runs while holding on for your dear life really sucks.

I live in a rural area and usually go road running near farms where there is almost no traffic. It feels nice to have a whole damn wide road just for yourself. Unfortunately farmers leave the gates open (almost always). Farm/guarding/hunting dogs feel the need to demolish anything that passes near their territory and that includes myself. Today I got chased by a corgi mix for a quarter of a mile and that was towards the end of my long run. Sometimes I cannot even continue forward and have to change my route so the run becomes unexpectedly longer.

I have been running a 10km trail route near my house for ages now. There are hunting dogs along that route but they don't attack since they got used to me. 
It can  become monotone to run the same route.  SO I have been changing and discovering new routes. It has been difficult to finish a run without getting chased by a dog.

I cannot convince myself to just stop sprinting when a dog runs towards me. The fact that I was bitten as a kid does not help as well.  When I am on a bike they will chase for even longer. 

I really don't mind small breeds. But something like a rottie/cane corso scares me.

Some background: I've been running consistently for the last 4 years (inconsistently since high school) and I have always done middle and long distance races. After running my first marathon last January I decided that 2020 was going to be the year of speed. I wrote down a PR goal for the mile, 5k and 10K and wrote out some fantastically optimistic plans for 2020....what could go wrong?

Training:

I used the beginner 5k training plan from u/Free_Running_Plans and I had a stellar training block. It was strange running low mileage with high intensity when for the last 2 years I had been laser focused on running as many miles per week but with zero speed work. I found out that I LOVE the track work! I would get nervous the day of a speed workout but it is fun to run fast and be absolutely destroyed. I found that I love 400s, hate 800s, love mile repeats, hate 2 mile tempo runs. Apparently I can't stand doing a second lap of any set! 

My 5k time trial at the end of the beginner plan was ok. I hit a new PR of 24:30 but the heat got to me (Houston runner problems) and I knew I didn't run as fast as the training had prepared me. 

I started the intermediate 10k program right away and focused on the week 4 5k time trial for my PR revenge. 

Pre-Race:

I was so nervous getting ready for this silly race! I poo-poo'd virtual races but since this supported one of my favorite writers and proceeds are going to the ACLU and Black Girls Code I figured I would pay for a time trial. I had my lucky oatmeal with applesauce and blueberries and several (too many) cups of coffee. I parked at the local YMCA and did a nice warm up mile, the lunge matrix and leg swings (because I'm not 20 anymore and my hips dont lie). The summer heat has broken and my warm up was 30 sec faster per mile without any extra effort. 

Race:

It felt so good to run in cooler temps!!! It was still 96% humidity but only 67 degrees and it felt freaking awesome. I take back all the awful things I said about Houston when I was hot and cranky. I hit the first mile waaaaaaaay faster than planed. My original mile PR goal was 7:45 back in February and in this race I hit 7:29!!!! I kept repeating ""run recklessly"" ""race stupid"" ""don't save anything"" ""\*\*\*\* you lungs you never did \*\*\*\*"" ""This is why I ran 800s!!"" ""Don't you dare try to run this like a tempo run"" but that first mile was a bit crazy.

About 25 feet before the turn around I passed a very fast and intimidating guy and we exchanged the little 2 finger wave and I was glad that he looked fast so I wouldn't have to pass him in 30 seconds and could possibly tuck in behind him. Turns out he was running a bit under my pace and I passed a guy that intimidated the hell outa me! When my watch hit 2 miles and I saw I was slower than 7:40 I shouted several swear words and picked up the pace again. At 2.5 the swearing turned into awful loud gasping and wheezing. At 3 miles everything went fuzzy and I went full crazy braveheart for the last .1

Post-Race

Turns out the fast intimidating guy had tucked in right behind me ever since I passed him and was enjoying my personal sufferfest! As soon as I fell over in the front lawn of the YMCA he gave me two thumbs up and said ""that was incredible!"" I shouted ""I got a new PR!"" His turn around was just past the YMCA and so when he came back I got to say ""I BROKE 24 MINUTES!!!!!!! 23:48!!!!!!!!!!!"" It was awesome and I was so destroyed. 

2020 has been the year of speed and now I am going for the 10K PR during the reddit Halloween race!!!

Just completed my first half marathon yesterday (didn’t run it with anyone or do a virtual race, just did it for myself). Yes I realize this post is me bragging, but I wanted to share this accomplishment also as a way to improve my time for future runs and how to keep training/rest properly.

Story time: I have always played sports but hated long distance running. When Covid hit, I cut out my gym membership and picked up running as a way to still exercise. First started slow runs (5ks mostly) and worked on my times (averaging 23-24 minutes now as opposed to 27-28 back in may). Maybe it’s been everything going on the world, but I have been able to clear my head and remove all the extra outside stress from running. I have always a more stuck/muscular build, but I have never felt better than I have from running (in terms have personal health and just feeling better).

Back to the half marathon—trained for about a month. I had never even ran 10 miles before this either, but did a long run last week as part of my self training test. I was able to get a decent time (just missed doing it under 2 hours).  I completed my half in 2:02:45 at an 8:10/mile pace. 

I  wanted to post here because I value this little community and it helped serve as motivation for me to do a full marathon (something that I never thought I would be able to do).

Would you think 2 months out from a half is plenty of time with proper training? Open to any suggestions from people that have ran farther and have been doing this longer than me (mostly because I hit a wall at 11 miles today and ran through a horrible cramp/body aches).

I run  (ran, before the pandemic) about 20/mpw, usually 5k, usually no warmup or stretching, I'm a terrible runner. My best 5k time is 22:22 and my usual time is something like 26/27 min for 5k. I've run a few halfs for fun (the last 2kms are never fun) and have run a couple of OD triathlons. I mention all this because the HR zones (the ""commonly used"" method to calculate them according to my Garmin) feel incredibly low.

I'm no athlete, but my RHR is 54/5 according to the Garmin 735XT I wear 24/7. I'm 34M, and the city where I live is SO FLAT I get out of breath climbing a flight of stairs.

[https://imgur.com/a/6ns2jug](https://imgur.com/a/6ns2jug)

I noticed that  there's another way to calculate HR zones which I think would make my workouts under this program feel more challenging or more appropriate. I expect, even when the later weeks of this program are focusing on HR2 long runs, and HR2/4 intervals with the occasional endurance run at HR3 thrown in, that the HR zones in the %HRR calculation (not the naïve one) are more suitable.

""It's upsetting that the company is starting to neglect their wide footers. This is the first time a 4E Kayano has left me with the nastiest shin splints and achy feet after a simple 5k. This NEVER used to happen. Even ran with my old pair of K25's and those supported me better. The truth is that this ""4E"" fit is too tight. No matter how loose I adjust my laces, they ultimately squeeze the heck out of my poor hobbit feet. If you have an old pair of Kayano 25's, just put em side by side and you can see the difference in width they went. So unfortunate because I loved this line of shoe. Take note ASICS, this choice of yours might have saved some material, but it's gonna cost a ton of wide footers to go elsewhere. Unless they guarantee they'll make 4E shoes as wide as they used to, I'm taking my business elsewhere.""

It’s not news to anyone in this world that this Spring and Summer have been a dumpster fire with COVID. I’m one of the lucky ones, here’s why. 

In December, my girlfriend and I moved to our first apartment together. By March, we were both hanging on to our jobs in the Events industry by a thread. 

In quarantine, we cooked and found ways to fill the time. Eventually, I couldn’t fit into any of my clothes. So, in mid-May, I downloaded Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club.

What started as yoga in the living room evolved into my first run, then my first mile... then two miles... and on it goes, as you all know. 

The dynamic between us started to change. My girlfriend was doing her yoga, I was blasting through 5K’s and eventually 10K’s. We spent less time together, and suddenly we were just room mates. 

6 weeks melted into 7 months and the seasons were gone quickly. I had achieved Green Level on Nike Run, and she was crushing streaks on her yoga program. We were focused on ourselves, but I was still saving money to buy her a ring. I love her very much, and believed in what we were building. 

The more I wanted to talk about the future, the less she did. The more I was stonewalled, the more I ran. I was ignoring red flags that were waving out in the open. I was paying distinct attention to the emotional and physical progress I was making on the road. 

At 1AM on a Tuesday at the end of August, I couldn't sleep. She asked what was wrong and, in that moment I just... broke up with her. The next day I woke up to bang through a 10K in 1:05:06 time. 

I grabbed a coffee after that run, and answered a call from my boss. He informed me that our PPP loan was set to expire on October 15th, and that I'd be laid off at that time. I had been interviewing with another company, but it was really slow going. 

With the breakup, we had to inform our landlord we'd be moving out on November 1st. Which meant I would be homeless, jobless, newly single and likely living on my sister’s couch in short order. 

I plowed through 125, 130, 150 miles. I was listening to the insanely optimistic Chris Bennett’s guided runs, meditating with Andy Puddicomb (who also has some great guides runs on NRC!), and chugging water like... all day. 

I started to appreciate the idea that “there are no finish lines, only starting lines”. The idea of endurance as more than a metric of fitness level. The undeniable optimistic and calm disposition that comes with running 15 to 20 miles a week was truly being tested... and it was (LOL) enduring!

I’m supposed to in the middle of a crippling nervous breakdown as the confluence of personal and professional problems mount at record speed. I should have folded like a lawn chair, and get THIS shit guys...

- That job? They called me and hired me. Paying more than I’ve ever made in my life.

- I saw the apartment of my dreams. I put down a good faith deposit. I got approved and am moving in soon. 

- I lost 25 pounds. Which wasn’t the goal but it’s nice to put on some clothes I haven’t even considered in a while. 

I felt good and feel good and it’s because running has fundamentally altered my thinking. Just the approach, the idea that you just take one step at a time. 

We didn’t have a bad relationship. But arriving at a responsible decision was easier because we turned our focus inward. That works for us, maybe not for others, but here we are. Maybe it’s part of getting older, but what I’m getting at is that creating an internal locus of control has led to positive outcomes (she landed on her feet too.)

My outlet is now running. I know why I go out every day. I have grown the ability to set intentions and, when I’m feeling it, hard as hell goals. 

Instead of looking at all of these insane problems that happened as the “end” of something or evidence of personal failings, running has brought me to a place where I just push through the next 1K (that’s a metaphor). 

A lot of that comes from watching the way everyone here and on other platforms talks about their running. Positively, moving themselves forward, supporting one another and looking ahead to the next challenge. 

I got lucky. I don’t know how, and things usually don’t hash themselves out this way for me... but again, here we are. 

Just want you all to know that I’m grateful for your energy and your approach. It rubs off on people like me who have learned that you can control what you can control and the rest is just set dressing.

1100,1100,1100,26,How Should I Handle This Blister?,1601169820,"I have been running fairly consistently for just over a year now, and I've never really had any trouble. No injuries to speak of, and no major foot problems. But I have now developed a pretty bad blister on the inside of the arch of my right foot. It's been there for a couple of weeks now, healing and then getting irritated again. 

After much investigation, I have traced the problem to my shoes. I've been wearing a pair of Asics Cumulus in a size 7.5, as was suggested by my local running shop. I normally wear a size 6.5 shoe, and I thought it was weird to go so much bigger, but I trusted the experts and I'd been wearing them for awhile with no issue. I guess after about 400 miles though, the size and wear has become a problem (I tested it by wearing some backup shoes on a run earlier this week, which didn't irritate it at all). 

I ordered some new shoes (Saucony Kinvalas, I'm excited to try them), but they aren't here yet. So I wore the Asics on my long run today. I didn't think it would be a problem, the blister was healed and calloused, no big, right? Very wrong. My blister is now, according to my husband, a blood blister, and it looks pretty angry, though it doesn't hurt. 

The hubby says I should stop running until it heals, but I really don't want to do that, I feel like I'm really gaining traction (pr'd my 5k this week and did my longest run ever today!), plus the new shoes should be here tomorrow. So, my question is, what do you guys think i should do? Listen to the hubby and lay off? Pop it and carry on? For now, I put a blister band-aid on it and it doesn't bother me, but I'm iffy on the best protocol here.

1109,1109,1109,36,10 Weeks and Pubic Bone Stress Fracture Still Hasn't Healed - Wrong Diagnosis?,1601162810,"So I'm getting really frustrated and depressed about this never-ending saga with my lower abdomen. Last October I developed a pain in my lower left abdominal region (I believe due to my foot slipping out from under me in the shower and something popping). I went to a sports doc who ordered an X-ray to make sure the bones were good. Came back negative. Next he sent me for an MRI (w/o contrast) to see if it was a sports hernia, also came back negative. Next was an Ultrasound to again check for a sports hernia with dynamic motion, tech couldn't see anything. Went through a series of doctors who couldn't see anything and at least 2 of them checked for an inguinal hernia and felt nothing out of the ordinary.

Finally went to a surgeon to see about exploratory surgery and he decided to check for an inguinal hernia once again. He said he felt a bulge when I coughed so we scheduled a hernia surgery which I  had in Feb. Stopped running for a couple weeks to recover and then eased back into it.

Pain returned soon after but I kept running thinking it would get better. In June I finally decided to go back to the surgeon. He said it sounded like the tissue just needed a reset and prescribed 2400mg of Ibuprofen a day for 7 days. That didn't help.

Went back to the sports doc who ordered a 2nd MRI (w/ contrast). Initially the radiologist said he couldn't see anything and the sports doc was going to try injecting Lidocaine into the hip joint but a later relook by both resulted in a bone edema in the pubic bone as the diagnosis. My doc said to stop running for 3 months and work with a physical therapist.

Fast forward to today. I've been working with the PT for 10 weeks now doing a lot of slow marches, squats, side planks, pogo jumps, toe taps with band, and a couple different versions of glute bridges. 4-5hrs of walking each week and some stationary biking are the only cardio I've had. The pain is still there. It's a dull ache sometimes and other times I don't feel it (just a general weakness in that area). The times I feel it the most are 1) sneezing, 2) squatting down really low, 3) lunge type motions, 4) sitting with my torso leaned over my thighs, and 4) lower ab exercises (flutter kick are the absolute worst).

10 weeks of no running and physical therapy haven't solved the pain in my lower abdomen that was  diagnosed as a pubic bone edema.

### Training
Throughout this pandemic, I've leaned into my running training to keep me sane and also keep myself from gaining 100 pounds from beer and burgers. Right before the lockdown, I did my second-ever Marathon in LA so I wanted to maintain my fitness. Since then, I've run one virtual marathon with some friends (@nevernotrun on IG) and the 4x4x48 Goggins Challenge with those same crazy friends. Because of that, I didn't feel a need to do anything other than keep up my normal routine of 3 weekly training runs, one long run on the weekend (ranging from 10-20 miles) and a hike on Sunday. 

### Dumb Idea
A couple months ago, I watched the Beau Miles Mile An Hour documentary and decided that I wanted to do it. I've been using fun challenges as a way to keep myself motivated, so this seemed like a perfect excuse. If you haven't watched it, the Marathon consists of one 3 mile run in the morning and then a mile run at the top of every hour for the rest of the day (I threw in some extra .1s to get to 26.2 before the day was over).

### Pre-race
The week before, I did a typical taper, but moved somethings around since I would be ""racing"" on Friday. I did a nice hike on Sunday (7.5 miles), a 3 mile run on Tuesday and a 2 mile easy run on Thursday. Thursday night, I made some chicken thighs, rice and carrots and drank a Pliny The Elder to help me fall asleep early.

### Race
I woke up late! Around 6:50AM my body jolted me awake (after hitting the snooze button too many times), and I immediately texted my buds that I was ""ready"" to go. I fell asleep in my running gear so I was able to quickly toss on my shoes, grab a glass of water and head out for the first 3 miles. For the next couple runs, everything went great. I still had to work during the day, and this amazingly made me more focused on my various tasks. Something about the hourly reset of having to run one mile really forces you to put in the work as soon as you're back. I also did some house chores along the way. 

The craziness really came at night. I've done a few late night runs in my life, but this was different. I didn't want to lose my mind, so I took quick naps in between each mile from 12am until 6am. I don't know if this actually helped, but sleep deprivation really scares me. I figured it was worth it UNTIL (CUE THE SHAME MUSIC) I slept threw three separate alarms for my 3am run. I don't remember doing this, but I do remember waking up at 4am and feeling very stupid. I think the worst part was knowing that I was going to have to make up the mileage with a 2 mile run at 4 in the morning. I'm lucky that I live in a relatively quiet and well-lit neighborhood, but there's still something very eerie and disconcerting about running in the middle of the night. I'm a guy, and I've had more than one woman in my life tell me that they'd never even consider doing that alone, and I absolutely get it. My friends and I checked in after each run to make sure we were still alive, but the more I think about it, the more dangerous it feels. OH WELL. 

I ended with a 6am run as the sun came up, and even though my legs and body were tired, I didn't want to die, so I considered it a success. 

### Post-race
I hadn't eaten anything since my dinner between miles 17 and 18, but all I wanted to was take a shower and fall asleep. I slept until 11am, which was earlier than I expected, but I immediately craved a coffee so I walked a mile to my favorite spot, walked home, and immediately ordered a mess of breakfast tacos from Homestate in LA. It's about 3:30pm now, and even though I know I could keep eating forever, I'm saving room for dinner and beers tonight. Overall, I'm super glad I did, though I don't know if I ever feel the need to do it again. These long day+ challenges are really fascinating, mentally exhausting, but not quite as ""addictive"" as your typical marathon/half-marathon/organized race. Hit me with any questions you've got, I might take another nap her soon.

1123,1123,1123,50,[OC] How low arches &amp; pronated feet can alter running mechanics: An evidence-based guide,1601154666,"Of all potential foot orientation &amp; postural deficits, overly collapsed arches and pronated feet are probably the most common in runners.

But it may not even be a problem. Lots of people have what some would consider ""excessive pronation"", but never have pain related to that orientation. It can cause problems if left unchecked, especially if it is a result of (or causing) compensatory positioning up the chain.


I will address the following:

* How pronation can develop
* Implications of pronated feet
* What we can do about it

TL;DR: if your feet are flat, you are not going to get your arch to ""re-rise"" without a lot of help, especially from something like an orthodic. Pay attention to your pelvis because it's a primary factor.

What is happening with pronation?

[LaFortune et. al, 1994](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henry_Sommer2/publication/14990874_Foot_inversion-eversion_and_knee_kinematics_during_walking/links/5a05a49baca2726b4c79fd72/Foot-inversion-eversion-and-knee-kinematics-during-walking.pdf) found that the most common scenario was that [the tibia was forced to internally rotate due to the valgus stress created by the pronated foot.⁣⁣](https://www.drcollins.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/FootLevelersBeforeandAfter.png)
⁣⁣

Interestingly enough, the femur rotated to the exact same degree so that no net rotation occurred between the femur and tibia.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Instead, all the motion induced at the foot traveled through the knee and was absorbed by the hip. ⁣⁣

*𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐤𝐧𝐞𝐞.⁣⁣*

But how does this happen?

⁣⁣**Potential Scenario #1**
⁣⁣

If the pelvic innominate bone is forward/anteriorly tilted on the side of the pronated foot, the [femur \(thigh bone\) externally rotates and turns outward](https://imgur.com/B5Faici). The tibia (lower leg bone) can [follow it into external rotation](https://posturedirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tibial-external-torsion.jpg) and then in order to not have everything go ""outward"", we walk on the inside of our feet for stability.

**Potential Scenario #2⁣⁣**

Another option is that the pelvic position can cause the femur to compensate into internal rotation. The tibia and knee follow it in. This is similar to what was described above in the LaFortune study.
⁣⁣
[This causes the foot to pronate.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopedge.com%2FArticles%2FViewArticle%2F2016-10-26%2F2016-11_06&amp;psig=AOvVaw0pRU-EzOCN9IFgTDBETSlE&amp;ust=1590943931358000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCPj1z5CG3OkCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

This is why it’s important to consider implications from both the foot and the pelvis. You cannot separate the two.⁣


**Implications of an excessively pronated foot**

A pronated foot that cannot go into supination effectively can stress the [foot ligaments and also the plantar fascia](https://www.pwfoot.com/images/plantar%20fasciitis_diagram.jpg) ([Bolga &amp; Malone, 2004\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC385265/).

It can also cause the foot to try and find stability via causing the talus to [move outward, stressing the subtalar joint.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FttXCXwTjR3t61nRMqsWZUk18EfnGJOX6Hlr_yTQS2dfJjDvaUSe1MIfuR2BrO3p3Do4VvdLZRxWJ8n9irTqWbjwRIRJXUnnrq9fhtASN_AkXbelcGFbPFeatPtHTEQ6PnZ7lf1L)

This can result in a faulty gait pattern ([ideal](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0909/6780/files/Gait_Analysis_d7fe4811-0b7a-4feb-836f-b349d9f576ea.jpg?v=1519541487) versus [faulty due to pronation](https://imgur.com/undefined)), which can cause [bunions](https://www.myfootdr.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bunions-feet-before-surgery-1024x768.jpg) on the foot to build up ([Golightly et. al, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4392721/)).

**What do we do?**

In all likelihood, your arch is not going to permanently rise again. The intrinsic foot muscles are just not even potentially strong enough to reorient the foot permenently underneath the load of your bodyweight. But that doesn't mean it's a lost cause.

We need to be able to sense an arch and keep one to a certain extent when we need that, and we can do that through orthodics (which is too individual to address here), but there are also a few tools at our disposal that are easy:

1. Make a [Paper Towel foot arch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYJgtVyRPSs) - This is a very effective tool to be able to sense your arch and help your brain ""sense the floor"" better.

2. Utilize [Janda Short Foot Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acTjKwkti5s) when doing stationary exercises like a squat or lunge. This will help provide stability throughout the foot and leverge the arch to do so.

3. Footwear solutions - To find a shoe that best helps in this sitation. [look for the following qualities
](https://www.hruskaclinic.com/file_download/71321244-e770-4a2c-be50-5dc81e34b0f4). It's hard to give blanket recommendations because footwear tends to be very individual, but these shoe qualities should be present.

But it's important to also recognize that these are mostly surface-level solutions. If your pelvis is still out of position and contributing to the issue, then these will only help so much. An optimal approach involves using these tools alongside a corrective exercise program to help restore a better orientation throughout the lower body.",running,conorharris2,False,/r/running/comments/j0dyat/oc_how_low_arches_pronated_feet_can_alter_running/

10k: 41:13 (Can probably run sub 41)

I'm a junior in HS and this is my third year running cross-country. In our coach's training plan he's assigned multiple 20-30 minute threshold runs broken up in various ways. In the past, he's described threshold as comfortably hard, and now he's describing it as the pace you can hold all out for an hour. I figure for me that's about 7 flat or 6:50s. I was talking with my team captain about this and he said that he talked to the coach about this, and because we will only be running 5ks and 3ks that my threshold will be a bit faster. More specifically, 6:10 pace. It's been fine, I've been running 4x5 minutes and 3x10 minutes at that pace and I felt like I was putting in 85-90% but I feel like that's too high. A lactate threshold run is supposed to be just aerobic enough that you produce the exact amount of lactate that your body can flush out. Then when we were assigned to just go for a 20 minute tempo I PRed and ran 18:58 at the 5k (stopped there cuz I needed that Strava clout). I pushed it a little bit because I wanted to break 19, but 6:05 is pretty similar to 6:10. Now theoretically, I think with proper pacing I could run 18:30 because my PR ""tempo"" was about 95%.

In March I could ran a max of 1 minute at a time, slowly. Did c25k and for the first time, after several unsuccessful attempts, I completed it. Over the summer, took a break from running due to heat and humidity but still got in walks and other cardio.

I found a race in my area that was very small and in person, debated signing up for 5k because I knew I could do it, or risking trying to train the extra distance over a 2 week period. Struggled through the training, maxed out at 8 each time. Old pains resurfaced but stuck with it. Got a notice a couple days ago it was moved to virtual. 

Decided to run it today, on an unseasonably hot day, at the hottest time, against my better judgement.  I had two time trackers and one failed. Used headphones for music which crapped out in the beginning. Definitely not my fastest but I think it's still a respectable time for my first time running this distance.

And it's okay, the problem there, is I move every day around \~ 20k steps, it's my daily norm, which I reach every day, and on Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday, in those steps, I include 500 squats. Then relaxing on Thursday, running Friday/Saturday, then relaxing on Sunday, and then on Friday, I'm back on steps/squats.

I had a good run last week where I covered 6k without any walk breaks with an average pace of 8'13"" ( negative splits ) 

I donno what was my mistake today, but my feet were killing me after 3.5k. My breathing was under control but my I had a lot of pain in the arc area of my foot ( I have overpronation) which forced me to take a walk break. I started to read online about walk breaks and I was surprised to see that its highly recommended on long runs. 

I am planning to do a 8k race in 2 weeks, and I dont know what is the correct walk break plan during long walks. I have never taken walk breaks since I started running since I thought runners are supposed to keep on running and skip walk breaks as much as possible. Is it acceptable to take walk breaks even when you feel that you dont need any ? or do people normally take walk breaks as a preventive action to protect their bodies from injuries ?",running,bartdidit,False,/r/running/comments/j0ageb/walking_breaks_during_long_runs/

So I've been really stressed last 3 weeks. All started by our hygiene sending me to quarantine as I was in prolonged contact with corona infected person. Since I'm struggling with anxiety (but actually thanks to running and exercising, I'm managing pretty well most of the times), my anx. levels skyrocketed (I can tell it also from my watch :D). After almost two weeks being locked down, I went for a run and I've noticed that for my usual low aero pace, I see increase in HR by almost 10 points for the same pace. Does fitness decline this fast(I'm running for almost a year now, consistently 3-5times a week), or can this be caused by anxiety(slowly going away now, but I know it takes time) ?

*Repost:*

Hey all, I hope it’s ok that I post this but I see so many people here struggling with injury and I’d love to help where I can.

I’m an Australian Physical Therapist who’s really passionate about uncovering and solving the root cause of common aches and pains - particularly those associated with running. And if it's ok, I’d love to pass on some really important information I’ve come to learn over the course of the last 15 years in terms of why running injures happen and what’s important to focus on if you want them to go (and stay) away.

Apologies in advance if this is a long post. I have a feeling it might be :)

Firstly, I think there are two really important things to consider when discussing injuries and running.

\#1 - The onset of most running-related injuries should be considered the last straw, not the start of something new.

\#2 - Running is, by definition, normal for the human body to do.

In my experience, running injuries are usually a consequence of something else, and the repetition of running just exposes what you took into running. It doesn’t mean running is bad for anyone, just that it's really good at exposing hidden flaws we accrue in other areas of our lives.

Take common running-related issues like Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendonitis, Shin Splints, Patellofemoral pain, Patella Tendonitis, ITB Syndrome, Anterior Hip Pain, Gluteal Tendonitis, Low Back Pain, etc. It’s important to consider that these are actually not isolated, different issues divorced from each other. Yes, they're all considered different injuries to different parts of the body, but they are actually just a different expression of similar root dysfunctions - which I’d like to highlight.

For example, even though issues like plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain are considered completely different issues, they generally come from the same basic dysfunction - ankle stiffness, hip rotational tightness/weakness, and even low back dysfunction in a lot of cases. Essentially, the presence of these kinds of “hidden” features force the leg to work around them ultimately loading up the foot, the heel, and the knee differently to what they’re designed to handle. And if exposed to repetitious movements over time (hello running), something within the entire system can be set up to fail. And I think this is really important to mention because many common treatments for each of the above issues are very specific to those areas - arch supports, heel raises, isolated stretches, VMO strength, etc. And the problem with these ideas is that, although still helpful, they don’t solve the underlying issues that created the problem, leaving many frustrated if there’s a lack of overall progress.

So the point I’d love to make to anyone trying to overcome any injuries at the moment is that you need to look at how your whole leg and low back are going regardless of where your issues currently are. Yes, there will be some specific things that will help manage your pain in the short-term, but a broader focus can shut the door entirely. And to help figure this out, here is a list of the most common issues I’ve found clinically set other things up to fail and why:

\- Joint stiffness at the junction of the Thoracic Spine and Lumbar spine: Stiffness here can short-circuit gluteal function. Do you have weak glutes? They may not actually be weak, just deactivated by spinal stiffness. Interestingly, I’ve found stiffness here also contributes to the onset and persistence of hip flexor pain, and patella tendonitis.

\- Stiffness in the lower lumbar joints: These relate heavily to the sciatic nerve which supplies and influences many of the muscles down the back of the leg. Hamstring issues, calf issues, Achilles issues, and even plantar fasciitis can be the expression of basic joint stiffness in the lower back.

\- Muscular and joint restrictions at the front of the hip: Restrictions at the front of the hip can contribute to anything from low back pain, hip pain, all knee pain, anything associated with poor arch function - Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, ITB pain, shin splints, etc

\- A lack of rotation at the hips: This contributes to almost everything. It’s insane how often improving someone’s hip external and internal rotation leads to an immediate improvement in the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and low back complaints when running.

\- Ankle joint stiffness: Put this alongside hip rotational deficits as a leading hidden cause of almost everything. Plantar fasciitis, shin splints, Achilles pain, almost all knee pain, etc can be improved by decreasing the presence of ankle joints stiffness. This one is so important to work on as a stiff ankle genuinely forces the entire leg to move differently in order to work around it. Any structure in close proximity to ankle joint stiffness will be forced to take up the load a rusty ankle can’t support, opening many runners up to aches and pain. It's also worth noting that ankle joint stiffness is different from muscle tightness.

You may notice that I haven’t mentioned much about weakness. Clinically, I find you can’t out-strengthen stiffness - meaning I’d prioritize getting rid of stiffness over going after strength if you only have time to focus on one. Clearly, you can (and should) go after both, but I find stiffness to be the bigger factor in causing the compensation needed to create adjacent injury. Interestingly, as mentioned above gluteal weakness is often a symptom of low back dysfunction. As the low back improves I find the glutes wake back up again. Clearly, you can do gluteal strength exercises to round this off nicely, but without the low back stuff, you’ll most likely have to keep focusing on those strength exercises until you get sick of them rather than stopping because you don't need them anymore.

I can see this is becoming a little long, so I’ll just plant the seed with a few other ideas that I’m happy to discuss in the comment is anyone is interested.

\- Variations in footwear do not make a genuine change in your underlying mechanics. They're a bandaid. Clinically I’ve found that if any footwear “improves” how you feel or run, it's compensating for something you are missing with your body mechanics. If arch support makes you feel nicer then that tells me that some hidden issues need to be addressed so you don’t need to rely on arch support forever. The same goes for heels. I find barefoot shoes are a great way to “expose” flaws in someone's mechanics. If you can’t tolerate being barefoot and running (which are both normal) then it’s a clear sign to me that something is missing behind the scenes.

\- The two biggest creators of the list of hidden issues that I've found over the years are time spent sitting and heeled shoes/flip flops. Sitting - particularly slouching is often responsible for much of the hidden low back dysfunction I see. The act of sitting itself tends to account for the majority of hip stiffness and tightness I see. Heeled shoes and flip flops are a haven for stiff ankles. Any range you don’t get to use thanks to the size of the heel is essentially lost the longer you wear them.

I'll leave it there for the time being as I can feel my own eyes roll over at the length of this post! Sorry if it's too long!

Ultimately, I just want to let people know that if you have an issue that isn't settling take a step back and consider what else is going on above and below the issue. Also, I genuinely hope that some of these ideas turn out to be the missing piece to someone's pain puzzle. Or at least the little spark in perspective that helps you find it. Especially if it's stopping you from doing something you love. Again, I’d love to answer any questions that might arise from this long-winded word fest.

Also, I have a YouTube channel that covers a lot of these ideas in more detail if anyone would like to go down a rabbit hole or two. Just search for the issue and there should be a video on it. If not I'm happy to put one together!

To test myself, I ran 10 miles on Tuesday on similarish conditions, but less vert. And felt great actually, and kept a 5 mph pace which is my race goal. So I feel pretty good, albeit nervous, about my race in 30 minutes. My husband is currently driving us. 

My first goal is to finish, and if possible, my goal time is sub 2 hours. For those that aren’t familiar with mountain trail runs, even most elite runners have to walk the steep sections.

My workouts were significantly slower when I got back on the track this September vs. last season, even though I trained consistently through the lockdown and was in decent shape until July. Any insight would be appreciated !

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys, I'm 21F and have been training and racing with my track club for 1 year now. Weekly training volume is in the 35-45 km range, and even lower on race weeks... so pretty low haha.

I ran XC last winter (I live in Europe) and I was rather pleased with my season. Before XC season was even over there started to be races cancelled because of COVID, then we went into lockdown.

During lockdown I trained as usual, would do one short intervals session, one long intervals session, and two easy runs weekly, plus some stationary biking. I wasn't doing too well emotionally and it was taking a toll, but I really wanted to keep training. For about 3 weeks at the height of my depression, I wasn't able to work out or even do much easy running, but I was consistent the rest of the time.

In June, my club was able to get together and I trained with them. I was in decent shape. Our track was being renovated so we would only run intervals by time, in parks and such.

In July we got access to a track. One of the last workouts I ran was 8\*400 with 60sec rest in 82-83 seconds. Nothing crazy, but it was pretty much in line with what I'd been doing before, so this showed me that I'd been able to keep my fitness up quite well through the lockdown.

July is also when I started to feel really tired physically, legs would feel really heavy often on runs. So I decided to take some time off. End of July / beginning of August, I took 2 weeks off running, and then returned with easy running, and one tempo run a week. Dealt with a plantar fascia injury while coming back, still trying to fix that.

Then in September I realized I was feeling very heavy for no real reason. When I went back on the track my times were catastrophic. That workout I mentioned earlier would be impossible right now, even though I've been training consistently to get back to running well. I also get cramps walking up flights of stairs and had to stop once to catch my breath while going up 3 floors (which is really weird for me... I should be fit enough to go up stairs without stopping, given that I train competitively).

One more thing that is probably relevant : I'm chronically iron-deficient (diagnosed 2.5 yrs ago, hemoglobin was 8.4g/dL and ferritin was 3ng). I've been on meds since then, hemoglobin was 13.3 and ferritin was 26 last July. That's when my doctor had me cut my iron dosage in half because he wants to eventually get me off the meds. I wasn't happy about that at all, but I did what he said. My last period was 15 days late, first time it's been late since I was put on the meds.

So I've been asking myself what the problem might be, and have come up with the three following options : 1) I'm iron-deficient because of the change in treatment, 2) I pushed myself physically at a point where I wasn't doing well enough mentally, and I'm now paying for that, and 3) I might've been asymptomatic with COVID and my lung capacity might've suffered.

Do you guys think this makes sense ? I'm taking steps to try to identify the problem, but any insight would be appreciated.",running,Anxious_Parsnip3746,False,/r/running/comments/j050oy/sudden_decrease_in_running_performance/

1176,1176,1176,4,"5k: Pace, mileage and workouts",1601101382,"Gonna be a slightly long post. Please bear with me. Or skip to the questions section. I want to know if my current workout is inefficient, because I do enjoy it a lot and never bothered with speedwork, long runs and all that.

My current goal: sub 25min 5k, possibly sub 22min by the end of the year.

**Background and pace concern:**

Been running for over 3 months peaking at 35km a week doing (4k + 3k) 5 days a week. Finally reached 5k, switched to one 5k a day and ran a 27:16 the first time(still my PB). Only ran it 4 times in total. 

Now 4k seems easier but it is slightly problematic to run 5k. My thighs are slightly sore the next day and the last km could feel easier. Although I speed up a lot in the last 400m and almost sprint the last 100m, the soreness was rarely observed with 4k. I know that speed up isn't ideal but goddamn it's fun.

Maybe I'm just new to the distance but I thought, maybe I lack the aerobic base. *I've never had any special workouts.* So I finally ran my first long slow run. A very slow 7k (45min, or like 32min 5k), that felt a hell lot slower and was quite doable. 

The problem is before this I had a simple workout. I just ran the distance and had a pretty consistent pace, which I feel is the most fast/efficient way to run any distance, given your capacity. Been running 4k for a while but even with the 5k, the pace felt pretty natural. It becomes a habit. I might as well daydream while running.

For my long run today, I had to actively pay attention on my pace to ensure it's slow and I don't automatically speed up, or slow down too much at the end. Took my attention but it was quite consistent. 

**Pace question:**

I'm worried if I would again have trouble running at the right pace for the 5k as the pace felt natural/hardwired and here I am forcing a different pace during long run. Would running at a slower pace make me *forget* and readjust for the 5k pace? Because then it would be an inefficient 5k. Has anyone had this problem? Or will it be natural still?

**Mileage and workouts questions:**

1. What's the appropriate mileage for sub 25min and sub 22 min 5k? Is sub 20 possible by the year end? Current PB: 27:16

2. Is simply running a 5k a day at near top sustainable pace not enough? How far could that get me at 30km a week?

3. Is the reason for slow improvement just low mileage or lack of variety? My 4k was barely improving over 1 month. But in general as I increased distance, slightly lowering pace, the shorter distance improved quickly, briefly and then improved painfully slowly. The pace was still as fast as sustainably possible.

4. How many long easy runs are necessary? I plan on running 6 days a week.

1181,1181,1181,9,Persisting Shin Splints (Please help!),1601093130,"TLDR: Posterior shin splints have persisted after months of PT and strengthening exercises, stretches, RICE, and even new shoes and inserts, all without increasing my mileage past 6-8 miles per week for about 4 months. I'm trying to join the Army in January and need to be able to run pain free. Please help!

I started running in May 2020. I initially increased my mileage too quickly and experienced knee and shin pain a few weeks in (primarily on my left side), so I began seeing a physical therapist 2-3 times a week for form tips, strengthening, and diagnosis of any imbalances. The PT fixed my heel strike and corrected my poor form, prescribed exercises for hip, glute, and calf strengthening, and advised a month of rest from running. I followed this advice, and in July started running again at 3 miles a week, then slowly increased this by .5 miles per week or fewer, until I hit 6 per week. I've supplemented this with biking and rowing to stay in shape. While the knee pain has mostly subsided, I can't run more than 2 weeks straight, running no more than 2-3 miles every other day, before the posterior shin splints return and I have to take a few weeks off again. In the past few months I've continued with the prescribed strengthening exercises, seen another PT who hasn't been able to find any significant strength or mobility issues, and even switched from a stability shoe to a neutral show with inserts at the suggestion of a running professional. Running on soft surfaces prolongs onset of the shin splints, but does not prevent them. No matter what I do, the shin splints persist and I am constantly having to take multiple days or weeks off to allow the pain and bruising to heal. 

I normally would just give up running and stick with rowing or biking for my cardio, but I'm attempting to join the Army and commission as an officer next year. I'll obviously need to be able to run without debilitating shin pain, so what the hell can I do to fix my legs? I don't believe I have any stress fractures, I'm pretty good at stopping before the pain gets too bad, but definitely have some bruise-like sensitive spots on my shins right now. This is incredibly frustrating because I feel my strength and cardio are somewhat advanced (I can hit the 13:00 max 2-mile run score on the APFT, and can deadlift and squat weights in the high 200s of pounds). I want nothing more than to be able to work up to 30-40 miles a week and get myself in shape for OCS, so if anyone has any kind of suggestions to what I might be doing wrong or what I can do to heal up and prevent more pain, please please let me know. I ran today and had to stop after 1 mile because the pain was getting worse and worse, so the current plan is to continue strengthening and mobility exercises while taking 3 weeks off running.",running,Tomatoland,False,/r/running/comments/izyxmk/persisting_shin_splints_please_help/
1182,1182,1182,11,Physical Therapist hoping to help those who's aches and pain are interfering with running.,1601091903,"Hey all, I hope it’s ok that I post this but I see so many people here struggling with injury and I’d love to help where I can.

I’m an Australian Physical Therapist who’s really passionate about uncovering and solving the root cause of common aches and pains - particularly those associated with running. And if its ok, I’d love to pass on some really important information I’ve come to learn over the course of the last 15 years in terms of why running injures happen and what’s important to focus on if you want them to go (and stay) away.

Apologies in advance if this is a long post. I have a feeling it might be :)

Firstly, I think there are two really important things to consider when discussing injuries and running.

\#1 - The onset of most running-related injuries should be considered the last straw, not the start of something new.

\#2 - Running is, by definition, normal for the human body to do. 

In my experience, running injuries are usually a consequence of something else, and the repetition of running just exposes what you took into running. It doesn’t mean running is bad for anyone, just that it's really good at exposing hidden flaws we accrue in other areas of our lives.

Take common running-related issues like Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendonitis, Shin Splints, Patellofemoral pain, Patella Tendonitis, ITB Syndrome, Anterior Hip Pain, Gluteal Tendonitis, Low Back Pain, etc. It’s important to consider that these are actually not isolated, different issues divorced from each other. Yes they're all considered different injuries to different parts of the body, but they are actually just a different expression of similar root dysfunctions - which I’d like to highlight.

For example, even though issues like plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis and patellofemoral joint pain are considered completely different issues, they generally come from the same basic dysfunction - ankle stiffness, hip rotational tightness/weakness, and even low back dysfunction in a lot of cases. Essentially, the presence of these kinds of “hidden” features forces the leg to work around them ultimately loading up the foot, the heel and the knee differently to what they’re designed to handle. And if exposed to repetitious movements over time (hello running), something within the entire system can be set up to fail. And I think this is really important to mention because many common treatments for each of the above issues are very specific to those areas - arch supports, heel raises, isolated stretches, vmo strength etc. And the problem with these ideas is that, although still helpful, they don’t solve the underlying issues that created the problem, leaving many frustrated if there’s a lack of overall progress. 

So the point I’d love to make to anyone trying to overcome any injuries at the moment is that you need to look at how your whole leg and low back are going regardless of where your issues currently are. Yes there will be some specific things that will help manage your pain the short-term, but a broader focus can shut the door entirely. And to help figure this out, here is a list of the most common issues I’ve found clinically set other things up to fail and why:

\- Joint stiffness at the junction of the Thoracic Spine and Lumbar spine: Stiffness here can short-circuit glutel function. Do you have weak glutes? They may not actually be weak, just deactivated by spinal stiffness. Interestingly, I’ve found stiffness here also contributes to the onset and persistence of hip flexor pain, and patella tendonitis.

\- Stiffness in the lower lumbar joints: These relate heavily to the sciatic nerve which supplies and influences many of the muscles down the back of the leg. Hamstring issues, calf issues, achilles issues and even plantar fasciitis can be the expression of basic joint stiffness in the lower back.

\- Muscular and joint restrictions at the front of the hip: Restrictions at the front of the hip can contribute to anything from low back pain, hip pain, all knee pain, anything associated with poor arch function - achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, ITB pain, shin splints etc

\- A lack of rotation at the hips: This contributes to almost everything. It’s insane how often improving someone’s hip external and internal rotation leads to an immediate improvement in foot, ankle, knee, hip and low back complaints when running. 

\- Ankle joint stiffness: Put this alongside hip rotational deficits as a leading hidden cause of almost everything. Plantar fasciitis, shin splints, achilles pain, almost all knee pain etc can be improved by decreasing the presence of ankle joints stiffness. This one is so important to work on as a stiff ankle genuinely forces the entire leg to move differently in order to work around it. Any structure in close proximity to ankle joint stiffness will be forced to take up the load a rusty ankle can’t support, opening many runners up to aches and pain. It's also worth noting that ankle joint stiffness is different to muscle tightness.

You may notice that I haven’t mentioned much about weakness. Clinically, I find you can’t out-strengthen stiffness - meaning I’d prioritize getting rid of stiffness over going after strength if you only have time to focus on one. Clearly you can (and should) go after both, but I find stiffness to be the bigger factor in causing the compensation needed to create adjacent injury. Interestingly, as mentioned above gluteal weakness is often a symptom of low back dysfunction. As the low back improves I find the glutes wake back up again. Clearly you can do gluteal strength exercises to round this off nicely, but without the low back stuff you’ll most likely have to keep focusing on those strength exercises until you get sick of them rather than stopping because you don't need them anymore.

I can see this is becoming a little long, so I’ll just plant the seed with a few other ideas that I’m happy to discuss in the comment is anyone is interested.

\- Variations in footwear do not make a genuine change in your underlying mechanics. They're a bandaid. Clinically I’ve found that if any footwear “improves” how you feel or run, its compensating for something you are missing with your body mechanics. If arch support makes you feel nicer then that tells me that some hidden issues needs to be addressed so you don’t need to rely on arch support forever. Same goes with heels. I find barefoot shoes are a great way to “expose” flaws in someones mechanics. If you can’t tolerate being barefoot and running (which are both normal) then it’s a clear sign to me that something is missing behind the scenes. 

\- The two biggest creators of the list of hidden issues that I've found over the years are time spent sitting and heeled shoes/flip flops. Sitting - particularly slouching, is often responsible for much of the hidden low back dysfunction I see. The act of sitting itself tends to account for the majority of hip stiffness and tightness I see. Heeled shoes and flip flops are a haven for stiff ankles. Any range you don’t get to use thanks to the size of the heel is essentially lost the longer you wear them.

I'll leave it there for the time being as I can feel my own eyes rolls over at the length of this post! Sorry of its too long! 

Ultimately, I just hope that some of these ideas turn out to be the missing piece to someone's pain puzzle. Or at least the little spark in perspective that helps you find it. Especially if its stopping you from doing something you love. Again, I’d love to answer any questions that might arise from this long-winded word fest.

Also, I have a YouTube channel that covers a lot of these ideas in more detail if anyone would like to go down a rabbit hole or two!

I’ve scaled back significantly and back in Dec-March I really started to hit my stride in the gym and I felt like I had a lot more endurance on the treadmill and other cardio equipment. I barely smoked at all.

\### Training

This was meant to be a longer slow training run, previous longer runs have been at the 21-22k mark around 7min pace, planned on extending this out to the same pace but 25k distance

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Double shot of coffee and two eggs on a piece of toast

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Plan was to knock out a 6:45 pace for the first few k's to build a little bit of a time bank and then just cruise through around 7min pace for the remainder of the run. Everything was going according to plan until I hit the 15k mark and realised my run was going to be a little bit longer then planned. Had easily enough fuel and water in the pack to not worry and just kept plodding along at my 7min pace. Ended up hitting the 25k mark in 2:49:04 and then finished up running 28.38k in 3:15:29.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

Body felt really good even with the few extra k's, I have decided to invest in a better vest as the camelback pack is starting to cause a few friction hot spots. I also decided to film this run with a Go-Pro and you can catch the footage of the animals I see on the run, what I'm taking with me on the run, why I am taking them, random trail thoughts, Australia flora and fauna education and someone saying the word ""cool"" more then a person probably should  -&gt; [https://youtu.be/tfR90n83OPk](https://youtu.be/tfR90n83OPk)

I have had problems with IT band pain, but the most painful is abductor digiti minimi muscles of my foot.  I was able to find a show that helps with these things and now I want to start getting back to some miles.  I used to overdo it alot, usually my minimum distance was 6 to 7 miles a day and I'd do some long (20+) runs on the weekends.  But now I just want to do it right.  I've never had any instruction on running or coaching.  My pace sucks and is completely inconsistent.  

So I guess what I'm curious about are the following:

1. What stretches do you find to be an absolute must and do you do them before/after/both?
2. What's a healthy daily mileage goal, I was thinking between 3 and 4 with a focus on getting my pace to be consistent.  
3. I'm really trying to increase my endurance, other than running what are other thoughts on other exercise you feel helps.

I'm not exactly new to this, but I keep hurting myself so I can only imagine it is something I'm doing.  Other info, I've done about 10 marathons, longest mileage was 68 miles and I would like to eventually get to a 100 miler.

My confident boosted and I began to believe I can actually do this half marathon. 
However now finishing this September I feel like I am going backward. Now on my 3 mile runs  I am getting winded and get frustrated. I sometimes cry because now I feel like I can’t do it..... has anyone ever felt this way or is it just me?

1220,1220,1220,50,"5k: Automatic pace, mileage and workouts",1601059682,"Gonna be a slightly long post. Please bear with me. Or skip to the questions section. 

My current goal: sub 25min 5k, possibly sub 22min by the end of the year.

**Background and pace concern:**

Been running for over 3 months peaking at 35km a week doing (4k + 3k) 5 days a week. I've finally reached the distance of 5k and ran a 27:16 the first time(still my PB). Only ran it 4 times in total. 

Now 4k seems easier but it is slightly problematic to run 5k. My thighs are slightly sore the next day and the last km could feel easier. Although I speed up a lot in the last 400m and sometimes almost sprint the last 100m, the soreness was rarely observed with 4k. I know that speed up isn't ideal but goddamn it's fun.

Maybe I'm just new to the distance but I thought, maybe I lack the aerobic base. *I've never had any special workouts.* So I finally ran my first long slow run. A very slow 7k (45min, or like 32min 5k) since a 5k may not be safe with the soreness, that felt a hell lot slower and was quite doable. 

The problem is before this I had a simple workout. I just ran the distance, say 4k and 3k and had a pretty consistent pace, which I feel is the most fast/efficient way to run any distance, given your capacity. Been running 4k for a while but even with the 5k, the pace felt pretty natural. It becomes a habit. I might as well daydream while running.

For my long run today, I had to actively pay attention on my pace to ensure it's slow and I don't automatically speed up, or slow down too much at the end. Took my attention but it was quite consistent. 

*Pace concern:*

I'm worried if I would again have trouble running at the right pace for the 5k as the pace felt natural/hardwired and here I am forcing a different pace. Would running at a slower pace make me *forget* and readjust for the 5k pace? Because then it would be an inefficient 5k. Has anyone had this problem? Or will it be natural still.

**Mileage and workouts questions:**

What's the appropriate mileage for sub 25min and sub 22 min 5k? Is sub 20 possible by the year end?

Is simply running a 5k a day at near top sustainable pace not enough? How far could that get me at 30km a week?

Is the reason for slow improvement just low mileage or lack of variety? My 4k was barely improving over 1 month. But in general as I increased distance, slightly lowering pace, the shorter distance improved quickly, briefly and then just stopped improving. The pace was still as fast as sustainably possible.

How many long easy runs are necessary? I plan on running 6 days a week.

I just bought a pair of New Balance 890 v8s as recommended by my local Running Room and took them out for a 5K today (which is a ""long run"" for me. I could barely make it 2K before I became aware of a strong sensation that the shoe was trying to evert/roll my foot outwards, and before long I was developing quite a bit of lateral knee pain.

From examining my old shoes, maybe they roll outwards a bit as the lateral edges are worn down? I took some video of me jogging in my apartment as well and clearly - I am landing on the lateral edge of my foot (worse in my right foot), where the extra foam in the lateral edges of the New Balance's are snapping my feet into pronation when I land. I am a tiny bit bow legged and I know I have some tight achilles that I am working on stretching.   


If you were me, what would you do here? Am I just new to running and just need to develop Achilles flexibility?

1225,1225,1225,55,A few thoughts on running 150 consecutive days,1601056331,"First, a disclaimer: I'm no fitness or running expert.  According to my race results, I'm right on top of the distribution curve.  My smart scale is telling me that I'm in such a bad physical shape that I'm five years older than what my birth certificate seems to suggest.  I'm also as unique as everyone else, so what works for me may not work for others.  So, if you think you see any advice in this post, follow your own judgment instead.

**Basic facts**

Let's start with the basic stats for by 150 day journey.  My runs are visualized [here](https://imgur.com/HKp76sH).

* I ran almost 1300 km
* I spent nearly 5 days running
* I recorded new PBs for 5 and 10 miles
* I ran a half marathon almost every weekend, missing only one

**How I got here**
I've been running over 9 years.  However, after initial improvements for three years, I plateaued and couldn't improve any further.  I never achieved any great consistency in running, and my pace stagnated.  I was injured at least twice per year.  Most importantly, I didn't enjoy running: I was frustrated with my lack of progress, so I kept pushing myself harder instead of enjoying my runs.  Then in December 2017, I got sidelined with plantar fasciitis in one foot and a completely messed-up ankle in the other (the result of trying to reach 1000 miles for the year with the PF).  I was able to return to running in April 2018.  The next month I took a one-day [Chi running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChiRunning) workshop, which drastically changed my running posture.

Since then, I was able to gain some consistency.  I could easily run every second day.  I started enjoying running again, partially because I saw a significant pace improvement, and partially because I remained pain-free.  I didn't suffer any injuries, and any muscle pain was far more manageable than before.  The only discomfort was a recurring foot corn, but I cut out the root in February this year, and it hasn't bothered me since.

A month into the lockdown, which forced me to work from home, I felt that I was growing irritable and found it difficult to focus on work on days when I didn't run.  I realized that I was missing my morning walks to the train station, which cleared my head and allowed me to stretch my legs a little.  So, I tried to go for a short, 1 km jog in the neighborhood in the morning.  I found that it didn't hurt me in any way, and it helped me mentally.  I soon settled on a 3.5 km loop nearby, and kept at it.

From then on, I've been on a two-week schedule:

Week 1:

* Monday - 12 km, aerobic pace
* Tuesday - 3.5 km, recovery
* Wednesday - 10-12 km, tempo or fartlek
* Thursday - 3.5 km, recovery
* Friday - 12 km, aerobic pace
* Saturday - 3.5 km, recovery
* Sunday - 21.1 km, recovery

Week 2:

* Monday - 3.5 km, recovery
* Tuesday - 12 km, aerobic pace
* Wednesday - 3.5 km, recovery
* Thursday - 12 km, aerobic pace
* Friday - 3.5 km, recovery
* Saturday - 21.1 km, recovery
* Sunday - 3.5 km, recovery

So, over each two week period, I only have one fast run; the rest is slow to medium.  For the 3.5 km runs, I just run how I feel like; for other runs I monitor my heart rate.  As a result, my pace has been gradually improving.  For the short and half-marathon runs, I have the same route, but I've got 8 routes to choose from for the 12 km runs, which is enough variety for me.

**How I achieved my consistency**

First, let's dispose with the external factors.  The summer was relatively dry and pleasant, so there were no days that would challenge my motivation to run or get me sick.  Second, working from home gave me the flexibility to run at any time of the day, and I could fine-tune my runs for the best weather or work load.  And finally, my wife was understanding that I needed a little me-time every day.

Personal factors are a little more complicated.  For me, the key to consistency was injury prevention.  In the two years since my running workshop, I learned to listen to my body with great precision.  At this point, I can adjust my pace or running posture to counter even the smallest niggle or discomfort I may feel.  I'm perfectly content to lower my pace by 20% or more if I don't feel like running.  Consequently, a few hours after even the most demanding run, I feel physically well.  (Exception here were my virtual races, which took a day to recover.)

I pay particular attention to my feet.  I rotate three pairs of shoes to prevent repetitive motion injury.  Years ago, I've received a foot massager that sends electric impulses into my feet to promote blood flow, and I'm using it daily.  Twice per week I use foot care cream to prevent any future foot corn.

I do take some supplements and medications when I feel like I need them.  When I feel leg cramps coming up, I have an ISO drink for a day or two.  That usually replenishes my minerals and salts.  A few times, my lower back was giving me grief.  I think it was related to me picking up and holding my kids, rather than running, but it could make my runs less pleasant and potentially lead to other injuries.  For the back, I take Naproxen Sodium before I go to bed, and it works like a charm.

Mentally, I don't know what to say.  I'm perfectly content with my running.  On my 3.5 km morning runs, I don't listen to anything, and given it's always the same route my mind is free to wander.  For all other runs, I listen to audio books, and I was never bored.  A few times I had to remind myself to run more slowly, but other than that I faced no mental challenges.

**Where to go from here**

I'll try to keep up with the same schedule for as long as I can.  The biggest challenge will be the darkness.  Another issue will occur when we are called back to work.  The gyms are still closed with no estimated date for their reopening, so I may not have the opportunity to put in large distances.  My worst case scenario is that I'll spend my weekdays with my short morning runs and cut down my long weekend run to 12-14 km.  That is, if the weather allows it.  I'm perfectly content with what I achieved, and don't feel the need to push myself further if I don't feel like it.

This has been a recent problem, started in March when we went into lockdown and I started running more often. 2-3 times a week, I go for a quick 5k, and it's treadmill at the gym on alternating days. 

Then my feet started hurting, it used to be both of them, not it's just me right foot. The pain is on the bottom portion of my arch, towards the heel. It would hurt at the beginning of the run, but then I wouldn't feel it anymore by the end of it. I'd take days off, up to a week but the pain always returns.

I've tried getting new shoes with more cushion, it did help a little. I finally went with a good pair with extra padding and a size up. It definitely helps, but the pain still persists.

So last year I decided to start running and train for a half marathon. However, I have been plagued with various aches, pains and injuries (resulting in me backing out of the half is booked)! Most have been self-diagnosed since I can’t afford private physios and in the U.K. it can take months before you can get an NHS appointment with a physio. Also when I have been to the GP they basically just tell me to do yoga or Pilates. 

Ironically I was seeing a hospital physio when I started running, for hip pain due to weak gluteus medius (so lots of clam shell exercises were given). 

Fast forward to Jan/Feb 2020 and I manage to get to doing 5km runs no problem. 

Then I get my kitchen redone, take a break from running, start running again, get (self-diagnosed) ITB knee pain. Take a couple of months off, concentrate on strength training...come back to running, goes ok, then I do a slow run, knee starts twinging again. Do a faster run instead, hip starts hurting. I take a week’s break again, go back to running, seemed fine, now sharp pain again in the hip. The original knee issues were my right leg, hip is left leg. 

I’ve never done more than 6km in one run. My average pace is only 7min/km and yet hello constant issues. 

I really enjoy running and really don’t want to give up because my body seems to hate it. I’m trying to do all the various strength exercises they say you should do for running. My single leg squats have massively improved, and yet, hello more injuries. 

I just needed to rant, and maybe see if others have experienced the same despite not being a distance runner yet, and how people have overcome it, including the mental challenge of just wanting to give up.",running,stowesa,False,/r/running/comments/izi9n2/does_anyone_else_feel_their_body_just_doesnt_want/

\- What mileage should I be running per week?  

\- How can I get better at sprinting? Speed workout suggestions? 

\- My running form feels so clunky. I have short legs, and after I watched a video of myself running a mile on the track, I need to move my legs more, but I can't. I seem to take humungous, but inefficient strides. How can I change it?

\- How should I pace a 5k (per each mile) if I'm looking to run 21:30 and under? Sub 21? 

\- How to stop from starting out in a race too fast?

\- Any mental tricks?

\- Also, I'm only 5'3"" and I weighed 130 (female), so I've been trying to lose a little weight, but I have a more muscular body type, so I don't want to lose a ton of muscle.  Would losing 5 pounds (a healthy way) make a difference in my performance?

Let me start off by saying that about 4 years ago I was in the best shape of my life, running every other day, and was a heavy lurker on this sub.

I was in such good shape that I became overly confident and thought “You know what? I think I’m gonna pick up skateboarding again”....well I did, and I injured myself so severely that I couldn’t run or even lie on my left side for months.

Needless to say I fell out of practice and here I sit, four years later. Sad to say that I’m now the heaviest I’ve ever been in my life and with my frame (5’ 7” male) it’s not a good look.

I’ve started running again, about two weeks into the practice but I’ve noticed that my heart rate seems quite high for the amount of perceived effort I’m putting in. “Running” a mile (more like slow jogging) has my average heart rate between 150 and 160, where as when I look at my past a seven mile run had my average heart rate around 145.

I understand that I’m older than I was, but 32 isn’t *that* old. My question is, when should I expect to see my heart becoming more efficient? Do you all have any tips on slowly improving heart function? I’m just afraid of doing too much too fast and causing unintentional damage..or worse.

Newish runner here. I started training a year ago for big sur half and have been running since. I don't do a lot of miles as I have AI issues but I do 1-2 longer runs (time) and 1 weekly threshold run.

I wasn't able to run for a few weeks due to extreme fatigue. My mile times went from 8:32 to 10:58. I requested labs and it turns out I'm anemic which I know is a common issue with female distance runners. 

So fellow females, how did you build back up, health and mile wise. I've never been anemic before but I am in shock at how much it has messed with my runs. My dr just said to eat more beef.

I'm looking forward to getting back but feel I could use some guidance from others who have dealt with this.

1308,1308,1308,39,Recovering from ankle pain after running for the first time in years. I'm not convinced about the therapy I'm receiving and the physiatrist I'm seeing. Should I look elsewhere?,1600968530,"Context:

I'm a flat-footed overweight male (~28 BMI) who used to work out at the gym and jog but stopped for three years and a half. Two years ago, I suffered a sprain on my right ankle from jumping a trampoline the wrong way. It took me a while to recover since I got plantar fascitis due to poor consulting from an orthopedist. This was because I didn't start using my right foot sooner and, admittedly, I didn't do the follow-up exercises at home as recommended by the PTs.

Flashforward to 2020, my ankle's never been the same. I feel mild pain from walking close to the achilles heel (I think) and and the bottom of my feet hurt from standing too much while doing chores such as cooking and washing dishes. 

Because I wanted to lose weight and become healthier I decided to reintegrate cardio by redoing C25K again. But I got some really scary numb pain and decided to go see a doctor and take some physical therapy. 

So, I've gone to two PTs and Physiatrist that ""specialize"" in sports. None of them have been any help. The first ones were barely paying attention to what I was doing, and the ones I'm going to now only give me very basic balance exercises on a balance ball. Both are a far cry from the old PTs I used to go to. Because I wanted to start running again ASAP though, I wanted to go to sports medicine type places instead. 

This isn't even mentioning my current physiatrist; he barely listens to me, recommends shoes with stabilizing support (which I've heard on r/running and other subreddits is OVERprescribed), and wants me to take 13 more therapy sessions in order to improve my balance further when I haven't felt any improvement whatsoever with my feet pain!

Oh, and he arrived late TWICE. Today was especially bad, since I had a meeting at work at 10:00 am. Therefore, I coordinated an appointment at 8:30 am to make sure I don't get there late. 9:20 am, no sign of the doctor. I asked the assistant, and she said he was on his way. ""On his way""? He's late by 50 fuckin minutes! I had to reschedule at 1:00 pm. 

All of this combined makes me want to skip this shit altogether and do some exercise back home until I find someone better.

I realize I'm overweight: I've lost 20 pounds already, and well on my way to losing more.  But it depresses me I can't even finish day 1 of C25K without my feet feeling like shit, let alone walk 50 feet from my apartment without having ankle pain!

Recently I got a small blood under my left toe and the blood is appearing next to my toe nail on the side. Now also my right toe had a pretty much dead nail with multiple layers..

So today I went to the doctor and basically he removed my right toenail and in my left toenail he removed the blood and told me to add Fucidin daily.

Anyway, the reason I'm posting here because he told me that this happens when your foot is moving inside your shoes and hitting the front and the back thus with time the toe will get injured.. So just wanted to ask does this happen with other people also? Is this the main reason?

**Background:** 22 Male. Have run both a half marathon and marathon in recent years. Took about a 6 month haitus after my marathon. Currently getting my mileage back up but wanted to go about it a different way, through heart rate training. Training for a half ironman in specific.

**Currently:** Been doing 80% of my runs in Z2 and 20% being in Z3-Z4 for two months now. Running about 32 miles a week. I have gotten faster by about 2:30min/mi since I started this regiment, which sounds great.

**Problem:** When I started this training I was having to run and walk to keep my HR in Z2. My pace was around 16min/mi when I first started. I'm now down to about 13:30 pace. However, I still have to run and walk. I crave nonstop runs and getting the runners high from when I didn't train with HR, but can't get that when I have to start and stop so much. I could slow my pace back down in hopes of staying in Z2 for longer, but I'm fairly confident I would still go over and have to walk at some points. 

**Question(s):** Recommendations on how to proceed? I like the benefits of Z2 training like not feeling exhausted and being less apt to injury, but I'm losing interest in runs without the runners high.

I started really slowly and arrived at half line (10,5km)  after 1h05. I thought I was doing okay and capable of more so I speeded up a little and finished the second half in just under an hour for a total time of 2h04min.

I know it sounds like nothing for most of you but I'm really proud of myself (I mentioned in my previous post that my goal was 2h30min). I really thought I'd never be capable of running that long without stopping/walking !

9 months ago I had an ITB, done PT for 3 months, and recovered. Then when I got back to running (6 months ago), I started feeling a weird feeling around my knee (same ITB knee). The best way I can describe this feeling is: all the area around my knee feels quite tight, and the feeling spreads and fades away to the bottom of my leg. Also, my whole leg from the knee down feels kinda heavy... It's worth mentioning that I have this feeling mainly when I'm standing still. When I'm sitting / laying / running I can barely feel it. So I don't really feel it when I'm running; only before and after. Of course I can keep running but I'm afraid this will lead to an irreversible damage, and of course I want the pain to go away completely. Another important note is that I've done an MRI scan during the ITB treatment and they found a horizontal tear in the medial meniscus, but the orthopedic doc said this is not a serious tear at all, it's nothing, and that's not the cause of the pain. He said the tear is so small and everyone who does an MRI scan may find such a tear and they won't even know... Also it's not that location that I'm feeling the pain so I guess it's really not that.

What I've tried: PT, strength training, stretches, foam roll, RICE (Rest for 3 months without running at all, Ice, Compression everyday for a whole month, Elevation constantly), Chinese acupuncture combined with electrical current (6 visits). Nothing is really helping, and I'm totally hopeless right now.

1343,1343,1343,75,"22 days after ankle injury, first 11K.",1600933825," 

Hello All,

Note: Posting again because the mods want me to post again.

This is my first post here so I introduce myself.I was not a regular runner before, I was on and off running 2 times a week 7-8km runs for few months last year.However the during the COVID 19 lockdown here in France, I started going for 6km runs ever 2-3 days following local regulations of staying within 1KM radius from my house.I started running to get fresh air after locking in my apartment for 3 months except going out once in a week for groceries in a supermarket 100 meter from my apartment.

I started feeling better as I run more and my interest in running slowly become an major part of life. This has made me focus on my running technique, increasing distance and avg speed, so I was doing 3 10Ks with one long run around 12-14k every week and my average pace per km increased from 6 -5.45 min per KM to 5.00 min per KM.Before exactly 1 month, I tried my first half Marathon, did it in 2 hours which was a big achievement for me personally.Lately after started running more seriously, it is more I started realizing the running philosophy, we all have the capability to unlock our potentiality to achieve many (great ?) things or do better than what we are currently capable of but sometimes we just don't know we are capable of reaching there.

like how we keep running in a long run after hitting the wall or we don't feel very well after 6KM and feel like stopping (due to lactose ? don't know) but in fact you push yourself and run 12km at the same pace. It is like you have potentiality to achieve many things in life and you just don't know you are capable of it.

So I was planning to run the Virtual London Marathon in October and started training myself for the event. I thought registering for the event during the weekend of 1st September and went for run in forest to do a elevation run. The trail in Sophia Antipolis (LavalMasque) was harsh because may be not many people running these days due to COVID and I was well in to my run \~4KM and was going done in a rocky trail and BAMM I sprained my left ankle and hit the ground.Immediately I know I cannot run for next few weeks it was devastating for me. I had to walk with the injured leg for 5km and I cannot even walk during the weekend.

After 2 days of rest/elevation and Ice, the swelling was ok but I still feel the pain on the ankle bone. So I decided to get a scan and went to the doctor. Luckily I was able to get an appointment for scan in another city, It is difficult to get immediate appointment in my city, earliest I was offered is in 8 days (:.The scan was done and showed no Fracture (big relief) but there is a rupture in the ligament so Doctor suggested rest for few weeks with physiotherapy.And I realized my left ankle injury started another issue because I was leaning more on the right leg due to the injury to left ankle and my walking motion has changed and started getting pain on Right heel (bummer).

My good physio treated both ankles and told me I just need relax and he suggested me to run but safely on a flat surface without stress on my ankle.

So today I finished my work and put on the shoes and started a run.

There I am back on my feet, very careful for the first KM and slowly started feeling like flying again (in my head :D) was doing very good for the first 6KM (avg 5min per km).After 6KM, felt like no energy in my upper body. From what I learned all these days of running, there is no need to quit. It is just my mind telling me the body doesn't has no energy to run. However my legs felt totally fine, I was not dragging my body and running with my legs so I kept going. It was not a great second half but the goal is to RUN and not running to beat my PB.

There I am, successfully did 11.6KM - (1Hr 3mins), 3 weeks after the injury. It was not the fastest 10K but compared to sitting on the couch for 3 weeks and 11K run, I take 11K in 1HR 3mins any day.

During the 3 weeks I started reading more about experiences or other runners, gathered inspiration and knowledge on how recover and rest my body. Kept doing core training, bought a wobble board.After the wait of 3 weeks, the run was totally worthy. Thank you all for inspiring many people like me, keep inspiring.

I felt warm and ready and just did it, resulting in quads cramping up a bit afterwards (not actual cramping but more like feeling locked and unable to do any more normal intervals), i could feel an oncomming calf injury, but worst of all is my groin area it really feels like in both sides that i messed something up (don't think anything is, just SUPER sore). 

Anyway i have a bet with a friend to do a 1v1 100meter run soon and i do not want to jeopardize my body like that again, so what warmup routine is needed for a 100 meter run?

# Background:

19/M - I played lacrosse and soccer for many years throughout high school, but never ran for just the purpose of running. The past two years in college I focused heavily on lifting, never really running except for the occasional pickup soccer game. In February, my roommate and I had a bet to see who could run more mileage in a single week. We went from running 0 miles a week to each logging 40 miles in a single week. This ended in a cordial tie, with each of us having pushed our body to the limits. I really enjoyed that week of running, but schoolwork and Coronavirus had me focused on other things for the time being. It wasn't until I came back home to Colorado and started running in May that I fell in love with it.

# Training:

My original goal was to run a marathon and to get my dad to run it with me. We both signed up for the 9/20 Tunnel Light Marathon, a nice downhill course in North Bend, Washington. My (optimistic) goal was to run a sub-3 marathon and qualify for Boston. After a couple weeks of building slow mileage, I looked for a sub-3 marathon training plan online. They were all pretty similar in terms of content, so I picked one that was laid out nicely and went to work. Unfortunately, after 5 weeks or so, the marathon was canceled due to Coronavirus.

This left me unsure of what my next goal would be. I stopped following the plan and was only running around 4 times a week. Still, I kept running, and I spent a lot of time running at higher altitudes (9,300ft+) in Keystone, CO. I also took up biking, spending a lot of time biking up and down the trails at Keystone as well as taking a day to bike up Pikes Peak with a friend.

A few weeks ago, I started focusing more seriously on the 5k, and set a goal to run sub-18. I tried following the last few weeks of Ryan Hall's 5k plan, but with school starting and me spending more time biking, I was only averaging around 20-25 miles/week. Still, I knew I could hit the sub-18 mark, and I wanted to do it on the 4-month anniversary of when I started running.

# Pre-Race:

Felt good throughout the day, university classes are all online so the day was pretty light. Drank a bit more coffee than usual, made sure to eat carbs throughout the day, and stayed hydrated. Had a bit of stomach troubles right before I headed out (probably from the extra coffee), but it didn't end up being a problem. Did a quick dynamic warm-up, jogged a little over a mile to the starting point, and did a few quick pickups to lock in the pace and get the heart rate up. I re-tied my shoes, had my 180bpm playlist bumpin', and I was ready to go.

# Race:

The weather was amazing. The sun had gone down and the air was cool with just a slight breeze. I felt great starting off and immediately locked in to a \~5:45 pace. I was really enjoying that tingly feeling you get when you're in sync with a good song, and I rode that feeling for the whole first mile. I was very happy seeing the 5:42 split on my watch, and while it was slightly faster than I planned, I was feeling great.

In the second mile, I picked the pace up slightly, hoping to have negative splits the whole way. My breathing was getting heavier and my legs were feeling a little tired, but nothing unusual for the middle of a 5k. Towards the latter half of this mile, however, was when things changed. About 1.7 miles into the course, the terrain changes from road to gravel (no bike lane so I'm forced to take the gravel trail alongside the road).

This is where things got difficult. I still finished the 2nd mile at a 5:39 split, which I was happy about, but keeping the pace on the gravel was significantly harder. My legs were already tired heading into the 3rd mile, and with every step I could feel my feet slipping slightly on the gravel and wasting effort. 

A couple more obstacles also contributed to a very painful mile. The trail is single track width in most areas, so to avoid running into a man and his dog I hopped across the side of the trail and down onto the road before crossing back on to the trail. Only a minor detour but my legs were not feeling it. Then, there was a pickup truck that came off the road and parked on the trail. Again, only a little detour off the side of the path, but not ideal for the finishing stretch.

Despite dropping to almost a \~6:20 pace in the middle of the third mile, I began to pick it up towards the end, finishing the 3rd mile in 5:59 and pushing into the final 0.1 at a 5:46 pace. With this, I barely broke 18 minutes, but nevertheless I accomplished my goal and set a new PR at 17:57.

# Post-Race:

I could barely breathe, and I had a crippling pain in my upper-right abdomen. I walked it off and sat down for a minute before my dad came to congratulate me, pick me up, and take me home. Looking back at my splits, I'm not too happy with the slowdown for the third mile, but it's good motivation to keep training and focusing on race strategy.

Looking forward, my next goal will be the sub-17 5k. I got a group of friends together and we're all planning to follow the full 10-weeks of Ryan Hall's 5k plan, starting next week. We'll have a little friendly competition to see who can knock the most (%) time off their 5k at the end of the 10 weeks, and I'm really looking forward to it :)",running,jrflat,False,/r/running/comments/iyqisp/5k_time_trial_4_months_of_progress_2300_1757/

The author, Christie Aschwanden, is the author of a book about athletic performance and recovery called Good to Go.

&gt; I was a devoted stretcher for years. My high school track team began every practice with a ritualized routine of stretches, and all through my college running career, I would never begin a run without bending down to stretch my hamstrings. Until eventually I started looking into the scientifically verified benefits of stretching, and I was shocked to discover that I couldn’t find any. Sure, stretching can improve your flexibility — practice touching your toes enough, and you’ll increase your reach — but beyond that, the confirmed advantages to stretching are non-existent. There are even a few hints that stretching could be detrimental to athletic performance in some circumstances. After seeing this spelled out in so many scientific studies, I quit stretching cold turkey, and I’ve experienced no discernible harms.

...

&gt; All I can say is that when researchers have tried to confirm that stretching prevents injuries they’ve come up empty-handed.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, I understand why stretching has so many devoted fans, and I’m open to the idea that it might feel worthwhile for some people. As I write in my book, stretching is “an excellent placebo, because it’s ritualized, it provides a sense of agency, and it feels like something’s happening, which can reinforce an expectation that it’s working.”

I felt just terrible all day. My stomach felt funny, water didn't sit right, I ate too many Chips Ahoy at lunch, and I did nothing but procrastinate my school work. When I hit the path, my legs felt heavy, my feet hurt, and breathing felt completely foreign. 

On the way back from the turn-around, I saw three girls roughly middle school/upper elementary age obviously searching for another of their group. I (20F) asked them if they were okay and if I could help. They told me they were looking for their sister who had run off with a friend. This is a nicer neighborhood and the path is very safe, but I was still concerned so I told the girls I'd keep an eye out and swing back around when I got to the end of the path. When I came back around, they were gone. I had seen them just five minutes earlier and the girls were nowhere to be seen. I also stopped hearing them call for their sister.

I headed back to my car and as I sat there trying to figure out what to do, I saw a guy riding a unicycle, holding the leashes of two dogs happily running along with him.

1383,1383,1383,20,Forefoot Strike vs. Heelstrike?,1600895275,"Okay, so I know this is a hot topic and I'll probably get 50 different answers haha. But, I'm a relatively new runner and I have some decisions to make. Here are some other facts:

1. I have hyperflexible knees. I don't deal with intense knee pain but sometimes they fake me out and I have to be careful going up and down stairs while carrying anything heavy. 
2. I wear little support bands under said shit knees when I run; just the cushy bands with the Velcro and they do seem to help a lot. I'm thinking about getting some sleeves next.
3. I currently wear Xero Shoes' Terraflex which are in the minimalist/""barefoot"" camp and I love them. 
4. I currently use a forefoot strike and I was careful to get started safely and not overdo it on my ankles. I am a drummer too and that's the last thing I need. I don't have any pain or weirdness after doing a run currently, though today I did a second run and have some tightness in my calves. I'm going to rest tomorrow.
5. A ""run"" for me is generally just a mile to two miles and I tend to alternate a run/jog with some walking. My personal best mile is about 13.5 minutes which is just fine for me. Maybe one day I'll get to 10 minutes but I'm not looking for speed really. Endurance, health and not hurting myself is what I'm in it for. I started running to see how it would effect my Crohn's disease and it literally feels like it has cured it.
6. I'm female, 5'2"", and 122 lbs. 
7. I've discovered that I MUCH prefer running in the woods to pavement/anything flat or ""boring"" (my words). I have so much more fun in the hopping back and forth off of little rocks and tree roots, though I did trip and fall once already. Woops. Running down the road has its place for me, mostly to get to the woods, but it feels like a chore.

My MAIN question isn't ""which one of these is better?"" but rather, do any of you intentionally use both methods, perhaps at different times? Such as, today I'm going to wear my more minimalist shoes and use a forefoot strike to do a trail run, but tomorrow I'm going to wear my other running shoes and stick to a heelstrike?

Right now when I (carefully) attempt to run with a heelstrike, I feel like I can't because I've gotten so used to the forefoot. It feels awkward now. But, I imagine with some work I could get used to it again. I feel like it would be great to be able to control my body enough to safely use both methods at will. It seems like the forefront is much nicer to my knees and what I've read supports that, however if I were to end up with ankle soreness or any calf issues, it would be nice to have another option. Like I said, I'm not looking to become a super accomplished runner but I'd like to get to the point where I really ""like"" it and I'm maybe halfway there. I don't dread it now haha, but it still feels a little foreign.

1390,1390,1390,28,First (Solo) Marathon Last Night,1600891829,"When I decided to do a marathon (literally last week), I set out with two goals: run the entire thing, and do it under 4 hours. I did both.  26.39mi in 03:45:16, at an average pace of 8:32/mi. Splits at end of post.

**Background:**

21/M, in pretty good shape (or at least I like to think). Do a lot of hiking/backpacking, work a moderately physical job, eat healthy and recently picked up cycling. Middle school and early high school I did cross country and was pretty good, won some townwide races but that feels like forever ago.

**Training:**

Uhhhhhhhh..literally none. I got bored one night after work in March (reduced hours due to covid) threw on my trail runners and started running again. Was pleasantly surprised when I could hold down 6:30min miles for 4 miles off the couch. Continued running but not on any schedule or part of a routine through all of summer, maybe 8 miles at most in one week. Last week was in a mood one night after work and decided to go for a longer run than usual to clear my head, hit 10.5mi and still had gas in the tank. This planted the idea of running a marathon.

**Pre-Race:**

I mapped a roughly 6.5 mile figure eightish loop (to be run 4 times) around my house, and set up an aid station at my truck with nuun, water, gels, clif bars and a banana. I've had some long days on trail and on my bike, so I knew my nutrition plan would be solid, and I knew I had the mental grit to finish the run, it was just a matter of if my feet could tolerate hitting asphalt for 26.2 miles straight. Up until a month ago I was running in my hiking shoes (well, trail runners) - Altra Lone Peaks. Finally splurged and picked up Altra Escalante 2.5s on an REI sale, this was my third run in them. The night before I ran a pacer mile at 07:40. The night of the race I ate about 2.5 hours before, just a normal dinner + the protein shake I drink at work.

**Race:** 

Got home from work at 11:15pm, hit the road at 11:30. I had the idea in my mind that the third lap would be the hardest, and it was. Lap one went smoothly, I felt great and felt fast. When I finished lap two I checked the time/my pace for the first time, and found a rather large (.8mi!) discrepancy between the time the mapped route reflected, and the irl distance. I was supposed to have run roughly 13mi, just shy of a half, and Strava was showing 12.3. so lap 3 just got even harder. 

Lap 3 was brutal, not only because I felt I was starting to bonk (FWIW up until this point I was eating clif bloks which I've never used, this lap I switched to Gus which I'm much more familiar with) but because I added the missing mileage + some to accommodate if I came up short on distance after lap 4. I figured I'd rather cover the 'missing' distance now than later. Posted my worst split times on this lap, but that also includes going into the house to use the restroom. Something I've never seen discussed in other race reports is a slight feeling of disassociation due to fatigue. Almost hallucination like. Only experienced it one other time really (up 34h straight on a hiking trip) but it kinda messed with me through this lap.

Going in to the ""race"" I knew lap 3 would be the toughest, but if I finished it, I would finish all 26.2. I was right. I left my truck after drinking about 12fl oz of water, having some skittles, and loading my flipbelt with Gus and a clif bar feeling as renewed as I did on the first lap. Riding high, all was well until mile 24.8, my right hamstring locked up on me. Thankfully, I am (unfortunately) very familiar with this after some long days on trail, quickly massaged out the knot, and pushed to finish before it happened again. Ran up to my truck euphoric and slightly delirious.

**Post Race:** 

Pain. Only pain. Kidding, sort of. Walked around a bit outside, caught my breath, asked myself what the fuck I just did that for, and felt proud. Made sure to drink some, but careful not to have too much too quick. All the gels really fucked with my stomach so I didn't feel well enough to eat a full meal, but had a couple snacks. Stairs were a struggle, and bending over to untie my shoes was impossible for a good half hour. Took a cold, hour long shower, popped some Ibuprofen and went to bed. Definitely feel sore today, but honestly not as bad as I anticipated, I did call out of work however lol. All in all a great experience, and something I was proud to be able to push myself through. Not really sure what's next for me as a runner, I'd like to start trail running and maybe do some events in the spring (if they happen) but other than that just keeping up a couple 2-4 mile runs a week after work.

57m, lifelong asthmatic.  Asthma is under control.  I typically run twice a week; mostly 5K in 30 min and the occasional 10k in 1hr 5 min.  I played squash competitively (Low B) in Alberta, Canada from the age of 35 to 50, and then due to shoulder and toe injuries, I had to give it up.  Sat around for a few years and watched my weight gain, so I opted to take up running a couple of years ago.  I hated it when I was training for squash, but I find now that I enjoy getting out and being active!  I am just trying to keep in shape, but not log so many miles to induce any further injuries.  At my age, I don't recover as I once did.  I have zero desire to run any further distances and my times are acceptable for me.

Anyway, my question is this.  When I'm jogging, I track my heart rate with my Active 2 watch, or with a chest belt when I'm on the treadmill.  I typically spike into the 190 to 200 range and average between 165 to 175.  Based on the 220-Age factor, I'm just above the recommended heart rate.  Should I be concerned?

(Sorry if this is a bit long)

I started running properly at the start of this year to lose weight and get fitter, which worked really well, eventually getting to the point in which I was running two 5ks and a 10k a week. About a month ago, I completed my first half marathon, which went really well. A couple days of rest later, I attempted to run a slow 5k and noticed a pain in my upper left leg. This quickly got to the point in which it hurt to run, and even walk. I've taken a month off occasionally trying to jog a short distance at a really slow pace, but the pain has always come back at around 2 kilometres. 

I've found the pain is only when running, and walking. I don't feel it at all when cycling though. I'm not sure know how to explain the exact muscle, but the pain comes back when doing ab exercises too, such as leg raises.

It's been a month now and I'm stumped. After resting it and cutting out running completely for the last month I went for a run today, confident that it had healed. Unfortunately, again after 2k the pain came back out of nowhere. For now I have substituted running for cycling, but I would really like to start running again at some point as I really enjoy it . I can't book a doctors appointment/physio right now either due to covid-19. 

If anyone would be able to point me in the right direction as to what to do for recovery I would really appreciate it. I've tried google and asking friends to no real avail

I am looking to buy a running watch and maybe narrowed it down to 2 Garmin, the Forerunner 45 or the Vivoactive 3. I was wondering about the main differences in the two considering what I want.

Se my question is; for those who know the Vivoactive 3, are there some specific things about running that it cannot do (or lacks) that could be important? I could get it for a better deal and could use it for some other stuff.

I'm currently 29. Feb 2019 I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, and July 2019 I had a Bone marrow Transplant. This is not a recommended part of any running program, and I would not advise others follow my example. Lots of recovery, one scary biopsy and then some clean biopsies later, I appear to, for now at least, be in complete molecular remission.

Cycling was my cardio jam previously, but I did that as a commute and I'm still not sure if I actually enjoyed it or just preferred it to sitting in a car being traffic. I also have a young Collie who needs lots of exercise, and she didn't take well to running alongside the bike, so I thought I'd give running a go.

Did a bit of couch to 5k earlier in the year, got to week 4 or so and then kept stopping due to various health issues cropping up. I'm a bit medically exciting still. 

A couple of weeks ago I thought, fuck it, I'll try running around the fields where I walk my dog and we'll just see how it goes. I'll run until I feel I can't, walk until I feel I can run again, and repeat. Dog loved it. She was running laps around me trying to herd me, and surprisingly I managed to run for about 10 mins before needing to walk. I was surprised, as whilst I constantly felt out of breath, I didn't feel too out of breath to keep running, so I was running for longer intervals than when following the program. I kept this up for 3-4 days each week, improving almost daily it seemed.

Today I just ran my first 5k in 38 mins. Well, 5.3k in 38 mins to be precise.

I'm currently training for my 7th marathon (virtual). During the pandemic my casual-runner husband has gotten serious and decided to train for his first marathon! 

We have a very similar running plan (but never run together thanks to our two young children) and I try and talk him through what his runs should look like on certain days (slow for long runs, speed work on certain days). He is very open to advice/appreciates the ""coaching.""

However...

...Now that we are getting into peak training he is losing confidence. He was supposed to run 17 but stopped after 15 because he couldn't get in the right mindspace. He set an under 4 hour goal but came home from a midweek long run announced he couldn't do anything faster than 10 minute pace. I've run with him before, I've seen his stats, I know under 4 is within his reach if he wants it.

I'm struggling with how to be helpful without pushing. We are going to run together for our marathon (I don't care about time, I'm just happy to run a marathon with my partner!) but I'm afraid his head will defeat him. I don't want to force him to run 4 hour pace only to have him hit the wall at mile 20 and not be able to push through. 

So I'm asking for your advice! Pacers, motivators, coaches, anyone who has helped a new runner complete their first big race. Any tips?

1445,1445,1445,84,Are there any high mileage training plans out there that focus on speed?,1600865784,"My marathon got cancelled but honestly my heart wasn't really into the training anyway.  The two long runs I did leading into it were fairly brutal.  I'm slow so covering 13 miles takes about 3 hrs for me and the reality is that if I kept going the 15-20 mile runs I'd be doing would take me at least 5-6 hrs and that's a long time to be out there. 

I am kind of ok with being slow (~14:00ish over the 60 miles I've done so far this month) but the fact is that speed is really going to cripple my marathon training efforts.  I would like to get to the point where I can at do an easy run at 11:00-11:30ish.  20 miles at 14:00 is close to 5 hrs.  It's only 4 hrs if I can hit 11:30.  I'm ok with spending the next 3-6  mos trying to get there.  There aren't any races on the plate and it gives me a goal at least.  

I'm not sure how to get there.  Currently I've been running ~30-40 mpw over the past 3-4 mos.  I confess some life events have got in the way this month and I've been closer to 30 mpw but I do plan to go back up to 40ish in the next week or so.  I did 78 (May), 118 (June), 132 (July) and 145 (Aug) though I'm only about 60 so far this month.  I've looked at some 5k plans but even the advanced ones have me cutting my mileage back significantly and I've looked at to maybe 20-25mpw range.  I don't really want to cut out that much mileage but maybe that's necessary for me to achieve my 11:00-11:30ish speed goal.

FWIW, my mile PR is around 9:30 but then I'm completely dead.  I'm not going to be able to give you a second mile at near that pace.  My 5k PR is 32:39.  I'm about 15 lbs overweight.  I could stand to lose that weight and that's one of my goals over the next 3 mos as well but I'm not under the illusion that dropping 15 lbs will magically make me 3 mins faster.

I too (like thousands of others) have become a COVID runner. I love it now. But I also wear contacts and have since about 15/16 years old due to short sightedness.

I tend to find if I don't blink regularly or focus on it that's when it can hit - it's just something I don't really need to be thinking about along with my cadence, breathing, pacing etc.

How do you guys regulate this? Do you carry drops with you? I could get sunglasses to block out the wind but I feel it wouldn't help a lot...

Then I went for a 3h long run last Sunday. I started it targeting to complete 32km in 3h (a 5:40 pace more or less, that should be in the boundary of HR zone 2 to zone 3 for me). The first 10 km were great. The second 20 were OK until the 18th km, more or less, when I felt my performance started to decrease, and from the km 25 it started to become tough, specially from the km 28. I ended up completing only 30km in the 3 hours, and my calves were burning a lot. After completing my run I had to sit down 3 times trying to walk 200m to get back home, but recovered quite fast after that and didn't get hurt.

She decided to start running with me. I used to run before, but kind of let it go during the Corona quarantine, im picking it back up with my mom using a beginners [Schedule](https://media.margriet.nl/m/myarxc06zkro.jpg/hartstichting-schema-hardlopen.jpg) (sorry that its in dutch, as I am in fact, dutch!) that I used and found it worked really well for me. Its supposed to be a couch sitter to 5 KM runner thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Im a bit worried about how she is doing. She isnt progressing as fast as she should according to the schedule. She also used to be a smoker for more than 30 years but has quit since a few months. I want to be supportive, as its good for her health and its also more fun for me to run with someone there with me, but I feel lost right now. She is having a few problems.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Due to circumstances she cant wear running shoes yet (She has a pair of running shoes but they were also pretty cheap so I dont know how much it absorbs.. but she is still trying to figure out if she enjoys running, so I cant blame her for not buying a 100 euro pair of shoes. I told her we could try to not run as fast or just stick to the earlier weeks of the schedule as to not overburden her legs too much due to the shocks of running on bad shoes untill she is able to wear her running shoes.  


\-She is telling me her knees get really warm. I dont think ive experienced this. I used to have a bad case of Shin plints but thats old news now. Is this normal?

\-Her upper legs hurt/get warm too. I feel like this is just because shes not used to running yet.

\-Her calves get ""naggy"" as she puts it. No idea what she means by this! But maybe someone can relate.

\-Her back is sore aswell. But this is what is troubling me. She has a tendency to overwork herself at home by cleaning WAAAAY too much or moving furniture around because god forbid she asks help to anyone. Could this be related to running and how do you know for sure its related to running if possible?

\-She frequently tells me she has to stop running because she is running out of air. This kind of strikes me as odd because I never really experienced it. She then stops and resumes a few seconds afterwards. She also sais she feels like the breaks we have inbetween runs feel like is too short to get her breath back. Should we take longer breaks? Or is this part of building up the condition?

I am hesitant to give her advice, because I dont know much and im also a 30 year old male. 

A few more details, she has a full time job, and frequently has to stand all day long at her job. She comes home, walks the doggies, take a cup of coffee, and make dinner. She then eats a little bit, go running with me, than eats the rest of the dinner.

She is also telling me her legs just feels like cement blocks and she is extremely tired. Again, I dont know if this is related to running or not we run on Monday, wednesday and friday. Should we wait two days before we go running again?

sorry for so much text, I really hope you guys can help me as I fear that what im doing is just bad for her. And I would love to keep running with her as its like the only thing we do together.",running,Oobaha,False,/r/running/comments/ixzlt3/hello_everyone_im_looking_for_advice_for_a_58/

I used to run a few years ago when I was lighter and fitter, but since I've gained a lot of weight since and lost most of my fitness you can basically consider me a brand new runner.

It's been some time since then, and I'm fairly sure it's shin splints. It doesn't hurt generally but as soon as I start running, I feel it coming again. I'm talking running for a few seconds at work for example (busy work life, gotta run around sometimes) and I don't want to run more than that as I don't want to make it worse.

I'm 18M at a BMI of 32. Yeah, it's bad, and I definitely don't think it's helping. I'm just so frustrated as I can feel the difference in my cardiovascular fitness, but can't run because my shin splints haven't gotten any better in two weeks!

Half - 1:40 (June 2019)
Full- 3:36 (October 2019)

I currently run 35-40mpw, no specific races in the works, but hope to ramp up mileage and shoot for a 3:25 marathon in the spring, provided it’s available.

My question is regarding training pace. I think I’m guilty of not running slow enough on my recovery and long runs. I think it stems from some sort of foolish pride mixed with the false belief that my body will become accustomed to “being lazy” if I run slow. My current paces are:

Mile Intervals - 6:45
3-6 Mile Tempo - 7:15-7:40
5-10 Mile “Junk” - 8:00-8:20 (supposed be recovery)
10-16 Mile Long - 8:10-8:40

Running was always my weak side. Always struggled despite being fit etc. I absolutely hated it, until recently.

**How I got started**

Friends told me, just start running. However in my case I knew this wasn't going to work since:

\-I hated it

\-Was always bad at it

\-Got tired quickly

\-Quitter mentality when it came to running

So I drafted a plan, first of all I planned a route.

**Planning a route**

Factors which I was looking at:

1. Safety (not running in some dodgy areas)
2. Accessibility (route not being affected by different elements such as weather,events etc.)
3. Easy to record on phone app
4. Easy to expand once I start to feel like doing more

Route is set, now getting into it:

**First few \*runs\***

I knew right away that there is no way that I would be able to run through the whole route I set, given the fact thinking about running would already make me tired before I even started. So I started doing fast paced walking while recording everything on the app. After few sessions I started to do slow jogging/fast paced walking. My goal was to complete the route I've set.

**After 10 \*runs\***

Started to switch between fast paced walking an actually running. I noticed that my recovery has greatly increased since first few session however my time for the route was not improving.

**Problem I've faced**

I had this mental barrier which I broke today. Before today, my quitter attitude towards running was stagnating my progress and performance. After watching some documentaries/motivational I came across a guy who said something like 'whenever you feel like you can run no more, you can actually run more'. So today I've focused on applying this logic and turns out that I'm better at running than I thought I was. It was this mental barrier which I had to break to release the current potential that was stored.

Felt proud because not only I think I've changed something in me in relation to giving up too early in running but also my timing for the route has improved greatly.

**So what has running taught me so far?**

1. Whenever you feel like you are done, remember you can still carry on
2. Record progress, improvements in time/speed will greatly increase your motivation
3. Rest days are extremely important
4. Rainy days are not an excuse
5. When motivated use motivation to power your run, when unmotivated use your determination
6. Patience
7. Not every session will be a good session but bad session is still better than no session

My Garmin watch offers training plans; I selected the half marathon training by Jeff Galloway.  Monday I had an assessment run of 5 minutes, after which my plan was created.  My first real run of that plan is tomorrow. 

The plan includes a run of 5 sets of hills...15 seconds up, recover, run down.  I have two problems: 1) Houston, TX where I live is flat, and 2) while I've been pointed to a place where I might try, we are on the receiving end of rain from a tropical storm right now.  I'd rather not drive the 25 minutes to see if this place works and if it does, run in the rain.  At least the hill that was suggested is paved.

My options are: 1) do something other than suggested in the training plan, 2) suck it up and run in the rain, or 3) attempt to use a treadmill at the gym.   The short nature of the intervals and time to adjust incline and speed on the treadmill seem like a PITA.

Yesterday I slept for 3 hours (Not sure what happened, just had a bad night) and I ran 5km with a pace of 7'27 km/min, I always make sure to stay on a pace that still allows me to hold a conversation. Now last night I had 10 hours of sleep and I ran 8,5km with a pace of 5'15 km/min and I was still able to hold a conversation, but yesterday if I sped up anything faster than 7 km/min I wouldn't have been able to hold a conversation.

Usually my 5km pace is 6'30 km/min - my conversational pace with 6 hours of sleep - but I tend to get less than 6 hours of sleep because of my work. So I'm not sure how I was able to hold this pace easily and not get tired at all.

Also, I'm fairly new to running, I once ran 11,5km but that's over 1 year ago and I really quit soon after, I started again like 4 weeks ago.

So, over the next 6-8 months, I want to / need to increase my aerobic capacity and in general, I just want to be much, much fitter. Part of this is that I have high-level military aspirations but right now that's not too important as I feel like that's quite far away, but still, you get the level I want to end up at. I'm 18y/o 6'3 220lbs right now (and used to be 265lbs). I THINK I'm around 25%bf and I'm aiming for around 190lbs and ill see if I need to cut anymore when I'm there (i also wanna be shredded af lol).

For the past few months, I've been jog/walking to try and increase my aerobic capacity, but it feels as if I'm not making that much progress. I've been trying to stay in the 135-150bpm range (jogging until I hit 150, walking until it goes back to 136-138 usually). [This](https://imgur.com/a/pPUE0u8) is a screenshot of today's jog/walk stats. [This](https://imgur.com/a/B1V0Ou8) is a screenshot of a recent 30min continuous jog that I did (i did take a couple of breaks because it just felt wrong keeping going when my HR was up at \~190, given that I know that's deep into Z5 and I was aiming for a steady jog.

Because I was so demotivated by not seeing results, I even went and made a [graph](https://imgur.com/a/g2m7LnO) showing my avg. pace for my 135-150bpm jog/walks. As you can see, it looks like I've made some improvement at the beginning, but its starting to stall, and I'm just doing between 14:00min/mile on a bad day, and maybe 13:45 on a pretty good day.

My question is: What is the best approach to increasing my aerobic capacity, so I can be like those of you who can happily cruise at 8min/mile in Z2 (I would be happy cruising at 11min/mile at Z2, I just hate the feeling of walking, it doesn't feel like work.) Some people have previously suggested just jogging for 30min and putting away the HR monitor. Others have suggested keeping at jog/walking, as it will take a long time but the results will come. What's the best way of going about this? if I do a 60min jog/run I end up covering about 4.3 miles usually, and I do that 4x per week, so about 17 miles per week roughly.

1564,1564,1564,6,874 miles. A years worth of running. Can I get ready in a week?,1600735510,"I just found a virtual running challenge online where you run the length of the UK. It's 874 miles or about 1407km. I run 5k between 2-3 times a week at the moment with an occasional 10k thrown in. This thing starts in less than a week. 

PLAN:

This challenge runs from the 28/9/20-27/9/21. A whole calendar year to run to get the distance done. Here's the maths behind the plan. 

1407/52= 27.05km per week. I plan to run 10k Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

If you run 30km per week: 1560km total (a surplus of 153km)

Divide surplus (153) by target per week (27.5) you get 5 weeks 3 days (5.56)  where it's not necessary to run (right?). Great buffer for injuries or scheduled holiday. 

ADVICE: 

Can anyone give me advice on...

Running shoes: I have a pair but need  to replace with something that is comfortable and good for middle distance on grit paths.

I mostly only ran the 3-4 months during cross country/track seasons then but on the off seasons I was usually still pretty active, playing tennis and swimming often. However, I am now a pretty sedentary person and my only cardio is occasional 1-2 mile walks. I started running earlier this week and at full effort I can only run a mile in 10:45. This is a bit disconcerting because I remember being able to easily run a mile in 9:00 during the first week of cross country practice with no conditioning during the summer besides the sports I played. But still, it's coming back to me and I'm starting to remember how exciting it was to run a hard workout or race, so I want to get back into it seriously and sign up for a 5k within the next few months or so.

I have also always wanted to beat my 5k PR of 25:06 that I made in senior year of high school because it was early on in the season but then I began to plateau due to possible overtraining (plus the time is so close to breaking 25!). I also ran a 800m in 3:04 and a mile in a little over 7 min (not sure bc it wasn't officially timed), so I wanted to break those because they were so close as well. 

Is it possible to eventually break these PRs?

I was never the best runner, and I sought to change that. However, I had always tried to run at every opportunity I had.

So, the past two months I’ve been running 5-6 days per week. I was basically starting from just north of scratch, where I could run two miles but my body and mind would both be telling me “Dude you’re in severe pain, your heart rate has been at max for ten minutes, and your time is shit,” and I’ve had to struggle to even hit the two mile mark.

In two months I still can’t reliably run even 1.75 miles straight. Hell, I struggle to run 1.5 miles even.

My heart rate is all over the place, usually my resting rate is around 50-60 bpm which isn’t horrible, but within a minute of running it jumps to around 170, and within four minutes it reaches 180-190.

I constantly get tibialis anterior pain (the muscle in the front of your shin responsible for pulling your foot toes-up). I used to get horrible shin splits which I recognized to be bone-based, so I replaced my shoes with a great pair of Hokas and that solved the bone pain immediately.

I’m a 5’11, 200lbs, 23y/o male. I lift regularly, six days a week, so I’m not overweight via fat. I used to run the 1600 on my track team in highschool too, but my best time was only ever like a 7:15 (like I said, I was never great at running.)

### Training
I used Hal Higdon 26 week 50k training program which I cut a few weeks off to make fit with my schedule. Training went fairly well thanks to Covid leaving more time to devote to running.

 I had three weeks left in the plan. Saturday was an easy 1.5 hour run with no issues, Sunday was a 4 hour run. I noticed a small twinge in my lower leg at mile 8 but not painful. At mile 11 it got worse and by 11.5 I had called for a pickup two hours early. Shoutout to my amazing wife for showing up to play ambulance on the side of the road in the dead of night.

 After two days of pain I scheduled a PT and took the rest of the week off. I was super down as I haven't dealt with an injury to date and didn't want to ""waste"" the time I had put in. He gave me some good advice and put a plan together that would test if I was fit to run. We also set guidelines to follow at the race to keep myself healthy for my long term goals.

### Pre-race
I was still waffling weather I was going to do the race four days out. I had told everyone I wasn't going to run but I had still packed my bags. 

I eventually told my wife I wanted to try, my runs went well and I started to realize I was in my head about the pain from that night. I figured if I dnf'ed I had already told most people I wasn't planning on starting so who cares. I set my new goal at making the 1st aid station at mile 8.8 which would be my longest run since my pain.

### Race
The start of the race went really well. A steep 4.4 mile section to Music pass followed by returning down to Music Meadows for the 1st aid station. Having your car parked 30feet from the aid and access to it mid race is SUPER coinvent. I sat down grabbed some more fuel, retied my shoes while my wife filled my bottles (again an angel for sitting in a field all day so I can run in the mountains). 

 I was under pace by a few minutes and feeling fantastic. I set out on the longest section feeling good about completing the whole race. 13.2 miles out and back along rainbow trail. I stopped at the really well stocked aid statin and decided to stick to water, my packed food and a handful of twizzles. I was still feeling good and on pace or better until mile 17. I was working my way down the trail when my stomach lurched and I had to get sick on the side of the trail. Huge thanks to the couple that stopped to check on me and offered food/drinks. I was able to get running again after a few minutes and I made it back to base camp at mile 22 still ahead of schedule by 20 minutes*(mid race pace calculation may be wrong). I honestly didn't feel that bad yet.

 I stepped out of camp on my way up music pass, only 8.8 miles and 2200' of elevation stood between me and my first 50k. Mile 23 went bad, fast. I couldn't keep food down so I hadn't been fueling properly and was running on water and watered down tailwind. Mile 24 was the worst mile I have ever ran in my life both in terms of speed and pain. I was stopping every tenth of a mile and making deals with myself about how far I could go. The next three miles where slightly easier but only as I had resigned myself to the pain. Hitting the top of Music Pass might as well of been the finish line. It's all I had fixated on for the last three and a half hours. The 4.4 miles down hill where better but not easy. I was able to keep moving with much more consistency and I even ran in the last .75 mile, a feat I couldn't have done an hour before. I ran in to my wife cheering and actual people at the finish line.

### Whats Next?
I really need to work on fueling and it will be the focus of my long runs but I'm going to take some time and work on a 5k plan and strength training. I think getting some speed work in will help my efficiency and I would like a small break from long running before I start in on 100 mile training next march.",running,Bunnyhopper_pogo,False,/r/running/comments/ix8ikr/i_completed_my_1st_50k_and_i_got_to_run_it_with/

1617,1617,1617,61,I hated running for 24 years. Today I ran my first 5k without taking a break. My secret: not caring about it at all.,1600712502,"Posting this because I needed to get this off my chest.

I've always disliked running. I just never had endurance when it came to that. When I tried it, I lasted only 1 minute or so until I had to walk and that was really frustrating for me. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't find joy in it. So I went for cycling and hiking instead and that has worked well so far, until now.

My major turning point was my first solo thru-hike (the Tour Du Mont Blanc) that lasted 9 days. I decided for myself to **hike as slow as I want and take as many breaks as I want because I have time.** And it was the most relaxing thing I could've done to myself. Literally everyday was fun for me to walk even though I had blisters and had to make 25k of distance and 1000m of elevation gain and loss a day. As someone who likes to push themselves to their limit, this was a new experience for me.

I came back home and decided I wanted to improve my endurance. I have a gym membership but now during corona I really don't want to hit the gym. My bike is shitty and the only thing that was left was running outside.

So on one day I was saying to myself:

""okay u/fasting_redhead, you will take one step outside and run as slow as you want and take as many breaks as you want - even if you just end up walking to the park and back. Worst case: you tried, you walked and you had fresh air. Don't track it, don't look at the time, pace or distance. Just take one step after another.""

So I did. And I ran around 40 minutes (maybe 4.5km) with a hand full of breaks. Slow and steady. **It was actually... fun**.

I looked at myself in the mirror, surprised and in awe of what I just did. I thoroughly enjoyed something that I have hated for all my life. 

I didn't take my phone for the first two weeks (now I do because of safety reasons) and didn't track any of it. I didn't want to obsess over numbers and compare myself to others - something that I have done most of my life with any sport. I know, this would be something one should know. That you shouldn't compare yourself with others. But when you read online about what is a good pace, what works for weight loss or how long and how fast you should run, it will be stuck in your head without you realising. It also comes down to your why. **And this time with running my ""why"" was not getting corona in a gym, building some form of endurance and being outside to do something for my health.**

That hike showed me that I do have endurance, just at a different pace. And as long as you enjoy it and get something out of it - it doesn't matter if you get to the finish line in this or that time.

Anyways, today I started my 4th week of running and I ran my first 5k in 35 minutes or so. I kind of happen to run 2x a week, but only if I feel like it. Because I don't need to go running to reach a specific time. Just to feel good. 

I actually experienced that runners high or flow that people talk about. It has been some interesting weeks for me to be honest. 

I'm looking foward to keep going running and to not care about it.

  So I take a beta blocker for prehypertenson and anxiety. I also started running in June and quickly ramped up to averaging 25mi a week, two 30+ in the last month. I love running, the affects it has had on my mood and fitness have been amazing. M31, 5'8"". I was 185 when I started, I'm 155 now. Intentionally eating at a small deficit and healthier choices.

  

  Anyway, does anyone have experience with running while on beta blockers and then coming off them? I've been doing fine while on them, slowly weening down per medical advice. I've seen the slow increase of HR as well, but it's been normal. Not asking for HOW you did it, but just in general how you felt. Was there an increase in performance? I feel like there should be. Did you have to start over with your 'metrics' and HR zones?

  
  
  I'm thinking the medicine is artificially inflating my VO2 estimates on my garmin and runalyze. Which intuitively makes sense, I'm basically running with a governor on my heart. So kind of faking out the algorithms. Garmin thinks I have a 54 VO2, 'superior', started at 48 in June. Runalyze started off in the high 30s and is now mid 40s. 

  

  Those seem off for a guy who was pretty sedentary and just did C25K in the beginning of June. Yeah I ramped up quickly, but still. Only prior athletic experience is HS sprinter/pole vault and then pretty consistent weight lifting in college. Since then, not much. 

  I'm not a great runner either, I just go long and slow. PR for 10k is 57min, as of Friday. Most runs are in the 9:30-10:30min/mi range now which feels 'hard', but I could still hold a light convo...

\### Training

I didn't follow a specific training plan. I started running back in May and got obsessed with it, so I've been gradually increasing my weekly distance up to around 45k/week these days, split between 4 runs, normally one long run, two 10ks and one 5k. 

I've already covered 21k a few times, one time I did 25k, and a week before the race I went on a mental reassurance run, in which I ran 19k at a 5:22min/k average pace, in which I didn't really feel tired at the end, so I had very high expectations for the official race.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

On race day was when the mistakes started to happen. I had my standard oatmeal with almond milk breakfast, which was fine, but then...

Mistake 1: Biggest mistake of them all, had sushi for lunch. In my mind it seemed like a good idea cause sushi isn't too heavy and has a fair amount of carbs, what I didn't take in consideration was the soya sauce and raw salmon. Soya sauce made me super dry, and the raw salmon would come and haunt me throughout the entire final quarter of the race.

Mistake 2: Kinda lost track of how much water I was drinking before the race. Wasn't really thinking about it but drank about 2.5 liters from the morning until the race began. Probably also due to the soya sauce which made me super dry.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

This leads me to mistake number 3, not sticking to my planned race pace. I had originally planned to pace at 5:30min/k for the first half, and then increase my pace to around 5:10 after that, then as fast as I could for the last 3k, but they played Eye of the Tiger at the start of the race which hyped me up way too much and made me go faster. Since I don't have GPS watch I was getting voice cues from Strava every 500m, and when it told me my pace, I just thought there must be something wrong with my phone's GPS, cause I really didn't feel I was going at that speed, felt much slower. Goddamn, there were even pacers throughout the race and I was like naaah, the pacers must be wrong.

Never listen to Eye of the Tiger.

After 5km was when things started who go south, from then on out, the rest of the race was non-stop torture.

I started to feel really painful stitching on the top right side of the stomach, which I think was a result of drinking so much water. This lasted up until around km 12 and really made me drop my pace below my target throughout that whole distance.

After that, for the next few kilometers, the stitching stopped and I managed to improve my pace, but that whole thing made me very tired.

Then, at 17 kilometers, the real nightmare began. The raw salmon started to make its appearance, and was showing no mercy. I don't want to break Rule #9 of the sub, but you can imagine how I felt.

Those last 4k were one of the hardest battles I fought in my life, the pain was only getting worse and worse until I reached the finish line. By no means was I able to do a last big effort, but I'm happy that I didn't stop.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

I just don't want to get post removed because of rule #9 as it took me a long time to write. Train back to my city was terrible but then again, rule #9. Leg muscles were sore but nothing too extreme.

Lessons learned:

1. No raw meat before your race.
2. No soya sauce.
3. Be mindful with how much water you are drinking.
4. No Eye of the Tiger.",running,nocjammo,False,/r/running/comments/ix509d/first_official_halfmarathon_race_report_many/

Quick rundown:
  - M31, 5'8"", 185lbs in May, 153lbs now. Running, IF, healthier foods
  - 50mg Metoprolol XR taken 1-daily, morning, for pre-hype and anxiety, been on this for 2 years
  - Started running in June and completed a compacted C25K really quickly
  - Quickly ramped up to 20-30mi a week now, doing almost exclusively HRZ2/HRZ3 runs, both long (up to 1.75hrs) and short (2-3mi)
  - Obviously ignored the 10% rule, but foam rolled a lot and stopped any run with even the slightest hint of a pain or discomfort. I've settled in to ~25mi a week I think. 
  - June and half of July I was on the full 50mg daily, halfway through July I started taking only 25mg and continued with that until Sept. 17th

  - July - Sept my runs typically stay in the 135-150HR zone range, I had these marked as H2/H3 in runalyze, garmin ,etc. These 'feel' like 2/3 to me... fairly easy and that's where I did 90% of my runs. Started out at 11:30min/mi avg and slowly worked my way down to about 9-9:30 this month, especially after the cooler weather. VO2 in Garmin says 54; Runalyze low 40s. Both have shown improvement since the start. I've always been skeptical because of my medicine and lack of running past. That would be quite the ramp up from out of shape to 'superior' VO2. But I thought ""hey, I've lost 32lbs, run 25-30mi a week, eat nice and healthy, maybe I am in incredible shape now?"".... 

Thursday, Sept 17th I decide to skip the medicine since I didn't see much difference between 50mg/25mg, HR wise, evening run seemed normal, slightly higher HR, but nothing unusual, run felt easier though.

  Friday, no medicine again, evening run is planned to be 4mi, but I'm feeling it and (assume lack of Beta-b) feel like I can easily keep 9min/mi pace and break 1hr/10k, a PR for me. I do, easily, 155 avg HR.

  Saturday, no medicine, it's a rest day, only do a 2.5mi dog walk. Notice avg HR is about 8 higher than a normal walk...

Sunday, no medicine, I go for a morning run and my HR is 150 within the first quarter mile. Gets up in the mid 160s, bumping 170s easily, while I'm struggling to stay above a 9min/mi, frequently hitting in the mid 8:30s, it's like it's easier to run faster than slower... I play around with pace, stopping to let HR come down, etc and it's like I'm either walking, with a normal HR or 160+... to stay in Z2/3 I'd have to speed walk?

   I was running a nice easy run, hoping for about 6-7 miles after my Friday 20 miler for this Marathon cycle.  It’s a beautiful day and a route I’m familiar with.  I was about one and a half miles in and I got to a construction zone.  This is one of those construction zones that’s had a closed off sidewalk for 3+ weeks while they rip up the whole intersection.  So naturally, I Ran right around the closed sidewalk signs like I have been doing all month.  A couple construction workers were there walking down the road, but everything was just as it’s been since August.  I thought.

  Got across the street and onto the next sidewalk.  Suddenly, I feel my foot contact what is DECIDEDLY NOT sidewalk. SPLOOT CRAUNCH PHBBT.  I just put 3 deeeeep sized 10.5 divots in a beautiful brand new slab of concrete.  The workers who weren’t around to block the sidewalk were suddenly everywhere.  One guy comes up and just stares at the ruined artwork that was a perfect 12 foot by 12 foot slab.  I start to apologize. A lot.  Not only am I definitely in the wrong here, but I’m a Minnesotan and a pretty non confrontational one at that, so “I’m SO fucking sorry” were just the first several words out of my mouth in a long string of self berating apology.  The guy just sighs and goes “it’s still wet, they’ll fix it. You need to go wash your legs off if you got it on you, because that’s gonna start to burn.”  I apologized again and ran away (much faster this time) back toward home and past the growing throngs of workers who’s shift I just ruined.  One guy mutters “unbelievable.”

**Race Name:** Logan City- Top of Utah   
**Date:** Saturday September 19th, 2020   
**Location:** Logan, UT   
**Distance:** 5K    
**Time:** 24:09

## Goals   
**1)** Safe goal- 26:30    
**2)** Main goal- sub 26:00   
**3)** Purely Optimistic- sub 25:00

**Training**   
I did not adhere to any specific plan so I’ll go over the most consistent things I did. Over the summer I was almost exclusively trail running. My usual route involved going gradually uphill for the first half of my runs, with about 750ft of elevation gain in the first 3-3.5 miles. My runs were always at least a 5k, and ranged up 10k with a run every once in a while of 7-8 miles. 3-4 runs a week so I wasn’t even breaking 20 mpw regularly. The consistent elevation gain took a toll and I hd to be very careful about my calves/achilles. Within my runs I also basically had a mixed pace. First half was generally 11-12min/mile, second half ~9min/mile and averaging 10-10:30.
Pretty consistent but was gradually getting slightly faster/feeling easier as time went on.

I had a virtual race in the middle of July and officially clocked in at 27:13, although Strava had me at 26:43 (there was some lag on the race app). I split the difference and considered it as 27 flat. After that I spent a month in Colorado and only ran once a week but was putting on quite a bit of mileage walking. 

Upon returning to Utah I started my usual routine again for a couple weeks, and then switched to flat running to gear up for the race. Once I did this I also was mostly just running 3.5 miles, the air quality has been intermittently bad so I often didn’t want to spend too long outside. A week before the race I was able to maintain a 9 min/mile over my run with some effort but quite a bit of gas in the tank so I felt pretty confident aiming for a 8:30 pace.

**Pre-race**   
I’ll never know how much this affected me but I admit I did almost nothing right the night before. I had my balanced pasta, broccoli, and chicken that I usually do before a race but then it went off the rails. My roommates &amp; friends were playing games so I ended up having 3-4 beers and stayed up past 2am (oops). I woke up at 6:50am pretty much fine though and headed out to race at 7:20. About 10 min to get there and my race was scheduled for 8:10. 

Masks were required unless you’re actively running and everyone I saw at the beginning was compliant. Since it’s a small race, there wasn’t a lot of people around and it was easy to social distance too. I did a couple of walking laps around the block with my roommate, and watched the 10k start. It began raining soon after so I stayed under the cover of a building until about 5 min before start. It was only a little over 50 degrees so I didn’t want to be out getting wet more than necessary. Did a couple strides and dynamic stretching before lining up and some jogging in place while waiting just to stay warm. We had 3 chutes to line up in and a started let off a group every 5 seconds.

**Race**   
I started in the complete back since I’m not a fan of standing in line for 10 minutes. Also, I like to chase people. The rain wasn’t strong in the beginning but got decently heavy by around the first half-mile. At the first mile marker I had 8:30 on my watch, exactly what I wanted. After this I suppose I sped up quite a bit, maybe because the rain was so miserable. 

There was an aid station at roughly 1.5 miles and I was already dripping, nearly soaked hair. I missed the 2 miles marker but around this point we turned south and headed into the wind. I’m not a fan of that anyways and with the rain I just felt really heavy at this point but kept slogging on. Throughout the race I’d been consistently passing people and not found someone at a similar pace yet.

Turning back onto the start/finish straightaway, I kept pace with another girl for a couple minutes. She got away from me a little more than a block away from the finish, and I couldn’t really kick until I was past the stoplight leading to the finish line. Not my best finish feeling-wise but I was pleasantly surprised by my time.

**Post-race**   
I stopped my watch at 24:18 and I couldn’t even believe that. I didn’t feel like I increased my pace very much at all after the first mile. After the finish line the volunteers waited until I got my buff back on and then gave me a water bottle and medal in a plastic package. There was no results tent, but they had a screen the results were running on. But it was only showing 10k results for some reason so I got my free food and left. People were not being good at all about wearing masks, and it was still raining. When I got home I had to take an immediate very hot shower because I was shivering so bad, and then a much needed nap. 

Going forward I’m shifting my focus to lifting. No more races here for the year and it’ll start getting icy in the next month. I do plan on still running 2-3x a week while I can, and I want to try a downhill 5k to see how fast I can go. There is a chance I can do a race in Colorado in late December, but otherwise I’m probably not going to again until next summer. This race is a real eye opener though because I’ve only gotten under 27 mins for a 5k a couple times before, and I wasn’t sure how much I could really improve. Hopefully I can maintain or not lose too much cardio fitness over this winter and inch towards a 20 min 5k next year.",running,magpie876,False,/r/running/comments/ix1pjl/a_real_race_with_real_people/
1645,1645,1645,90,Ankle and Knee pain,1600698840,"I started running seriously at the start of lockdown in Ireland (March). On my third or 4th run, I did a 17k run in a pair of €30 shoes. Needles to say, I fucked up my knees big time. This stopped from running for a while but I eventually got back into it, taking my time and only doing runs at around the 3-5 kilometer mark. These days I run in a pair of flats which are supposed to be better (although I know this is a debate). I subscribe to Kelly Starrets ideas on running and am currently working on some physio from his book ""becoming a supple leapord"". 


Despite all this, my runs have gotten harder and worse, so much so that I'm thinking of giving it up, which I really dont want to do. The pain is nothing major, but its somewhat constant and worst in the morning. I also work as a full time chef so I'm on my feet all day standing around. I'm also working on my foot posture but nothing really seems to be helping me.

I need some advice. I'm only 21 and I'm already worrying and having to get surgery if it gets worse.

1. I’m a serious heel striker. I’ve been told I’m a noisy walker and runner.
2. My core is pretty weak, as in I get lower back pains when I go on long walks/bike rides.
3. I don’t think I lift my legs enough, if that makes sense. Sometimes I feel like I’m scuffing my feet.

\### Background

I've been into running on and off for most of my life. 2 years ago, I was running a lot, and loving it. But college life, and not being able to manage my diet properly (honestly felt like no matter how much I ate I could not maintain my weight) meant I was a lot skinnier than I would like.  


Last year, was spent completely in the gym, just 2km of running everyday on the treadmill. Not running sucked, and while I enjoyed the gainz, I was really missing it.  


Corona, going home, and gyms being shut - meant it was time to start running again!

\### Training

Started on 16th May, was first focussed on finding my feet again. Ran 56 km that month, and started the Hal Higdon Intermediate HM Plan at the end of the month.  
June was fun, with a 157 km run. I was quite far from my old pace, but I think it also came down to it being super fucking hot.  
July started off really well, but than I lost 21 days in shifting cities, and a 14 day home quarantine. Abandoned HH.

August I just ran by feel, completed 200Kms. Started trying to run my easy runs a lot slower (buying a Garmin, and keeping track of my HR closely helped here).  
Made myself feel better about running slow by doing a 5k (22:41) and 10k (48:35) time trials.

Come September, I decided to participate in the HM. I freaked out a little about not doing enough tempo work, and started including one or two tempo runs in the weeks leading up to it.  


\### Pre Race

My biggest concern going into the race was dealing with the heat. For context, it is usually 32 - 34 degrees, with 80% + humidity by 8 a.m.  
Plan was to be out of the gate by 5, get done by 7.  


Woke up to it raining, couldn't leave till 6:30 a.m. Sat in bed, had coffee and toast. The rain turned out to be a game-changer, light drizzle, with beautiful weather throughout the run.  
\###  Race

I was feeling awesome, weather was great, I went off the blocks wayy too fast. Decided to tone it down a bit, but still went faster than the planned pace of 5:20 - 5:30. Grabbed water at 7, and 14km.

Honestly, except the last 2km, I felt really really good. Was a lovely run.

I'm really, really happy with my time. 1:50 was definitely a distant thought in the head, so quite happy to achieve it.

\### Post-race

Stretched, relaxed, had beers and fried chicken.  


Question is what next? I'm thinking I'll spend a month and a half on working for a sub 20 5k, and then decide whether  I want to prepare for a marathon, or a faster HM.

### Training
Before I started training for this race, I've never run anything longer than 15k a couple of years ago, and after that run I was sure I'd never change that, because I did not feel so good after that. Back then in 2018 I was training for my local 10k, which I finished in around 52 minutes.
Earlier this year I started occasionally running on the treadmill and loops in the gym, totaling maybe 20 km per a week. But then we decided to get us fit first and then start a half-marathon training.
Both of us, u/k8ua and me, used Runkeeper's sub-2h HM training, started 16 weeks before the assumed date of the race. It included 3 training sessions per a week, generally intervals in the beginning of the week, recovery run in the middle, and a long run on a weekend.
The plan has a training halfsy 3 weeks prior to the actual race, which should have had the pace of 6:25-6:55 min/km (race pace is 5:41 min/km). How surprised we were when we kept 5:05 min/km for over 10 kilometers after initial takeoff and slowed down just at the very end to adjust the terrain. Not only had we outrun the runkeeper's recommended pace, but we also finished at 1hr 55 min! Which was better than our plan for the race! We felt great and recovery was easy.
For the race day we decided to challenge ourselves even more and at least attempt to beat our PR.

### Pre-race
 After packet pickup, the dinner on the race eve had pasta and some more carbs. We had to be at the start point at 7:30 am next morning, which meant leaving warm and cozy beds at 5:30. Being a night owl doesn't really help, but I managed. Packed 24 ounces of water and chews for carbs for the run. 

### Race
We decided to start lightly, our comfortable pace was around 5:20-5:25 min/km, which is way ahead of 5:41 needed for a sub-2 run, but could be not enough for a new PR. The track goes slightly uphill in the first km and then goes descending almost all the way to the turnaround. So we thought it would be wise to let ourselves run maybe just a bit faster in the first half, to help us save some time for climbing all the way back.
You can probably see that we really slowed down a bit after 11th km, but then we used our chews. 15th kilometer was easy, probably due to the sugar boost. I took more chews a bit later to make the final push, and that let me run the last km at 4:34 min:km! We finished at around 1hr 47min and the feelings were great!

I ran down my driveway and started down the front of my lawn but had to stop and walk before I made it to my neighbor's yard. At first I was astonished at how hard running was. I had seen guys on the track at school just trucking it for what seemed like forever, a million times faster than I was going. How could I possibly be that out of shape?? I mean I knew I was overweight but damn I had no clue the enormous gulf that lay between me and those kids. This was very discouraging and I thought about dropping out of the ROTC program before I even started but it was very important to me for certain reasons and I decided to commit to seeing how far I could develop myself before school started. I don't remember the exact time off the top of my head but I left for school with a mile time of about 10 minutes I believe, even getting to where I could run a mile without having to stop and walk at all.

I was proud of the work I had done but flash forward \~2 years to now, I ended up staying in the ROTC program and during the quarantine I really started working on my running with a passion. I had been running the past two years in school, but not really any more than I had to, however when quarantine started I really started to push myself and try to find my limits. I was watching a lot of YouTube videos and listening to podcasts about running, I was and still am fascinated with ultra running and this only added fuel to the fire. Right now the longest run I've been able to finish was 11 miles with only a few stops when I had to for stoplights, and my pace was about 10:30 average which felt very comfortable until I got to the last couple miles when my calves really started to feel it. That being said, I am training for a local marathon in December and am just looking to hear any wisdom from more experienced runners who've done all this before. It doesn't even have to be specifically related to my story it could be for anyone looking to complete their first marathon.

Honestly I hated the first mile of the run. I was running in the city so the constant stop and go of cross signals didn’t help but I wanted to at least make it to a nicer area for running along the water ~2 miles from my place. 

I got there and it started feeling great to be back running. I got in the zone and just started running. I was surrounded by so many other people running or walking and the few times I wanted to stop I told myself to keep going because I wasn’t in pain or struggling too much. 

Eventually I found myself at 8 miles and I was amazed. I decided to see if I could push it to 10 and then when I hit 10 I thought why not try for 13.1? 

I will say the last three miles or so were not the greatest. My legs started to hurt and I could feel myself starting to slow down and my form break down but since I was so close I just pushed through it and it was great.

I've been struggling with some left leg issues for about two months now. I'm planning to go to the doctor, but from my self-diagnosis I think it might be IT Band Syndrome.


I think I got it from overuse, not a specific incident. I was playing lots of basketball when my left knee started to ache, and I foolishly continued playing for days until it got worse. 


Strangely, it's hard to locate the pain and I although I can still run/play with this injury, it's not until afterwards where I feel the area get tender and sore.


I tried foam rolling, and the most effective was rolling my TFL muscle and quad. After a foam roll session, I feel 100%, but only for a while. I rested for around 6-8 weeks, and it felt healed. When I returned to basketball/running, the injury came back, and it's so incredibly frustrating and makes me wonder if I torn my meniscus or something..

I incorporated running into my fitness routine about a year ago, because it is an enjoyable form of cardiovascular exercise for me; I also enjoy cardio workouts at the gym, calisthenics, circuit training, and dumbbell workouts. Currently, my weekly mile average is 10-20 miles per week. My normal runs are 5ks to 10ks, or somewhere in between, at 6:45 to 7:30 per mile average pace, which is the easy, comfortable range for me; however, I have not incorporated speed or interval training into my routine. My longest run (road course) was 15k (last Sunday 9/13/20) at 6:58 per mile average pace.

Recently, I have become interested in running distances in the 5k to 10k range at faster paces and am gradually getting my body used to running faster. To help me with this, I recently did a couple of one-mile time trials over the past couple of weeks and did a two-mile time trial today (Sunday 9/20/20): I used the Nike run app multiple times to consistently map a one-mile and two-mile road course around my neighborhood, which has hills, flats, and downhills; my time trials were ran on this road course. Both one-mile time trial warmups consisted of dynamic stretches, lunges, butt kicks, a 5-minute walk, and then a one-mile warmup run at a very easy 7:45 to 8:00 minute mile pace; the two-mile time trial had the same warmup minus the one-mile warmup run.

The one-mile time trials were 5:19 and 5:18 respectively: after each time trial, I had more strength and energy left and was not exhausted at the end; the 5:19 trial was followed up a few minutes afterward with a 3 mile run at 7:00 minute mile pace on the road course; the 5:18 time trial was followed up about 5 minutes afterward with a 5K at 7:21 minute mile pace on a grassy, cross country type of course near my neighborhood (I’ve mapped this with my Nike run app too). The two-mile time trial was 11:00: I felt no pain or anguish during the run and was not exhausted at the end and had more strength and energy left; I followed this up about 5-10 minutes later with a 5k at 7:22 pace on the grassy, cross country course. Each cool down run after each time trial was followed up with a 5-minute walk and static stretching.

Goals

As a personal challenge, I would like to get out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to run at faster paces over the 5K to 10K range without over doing it (e.g. perhaps sub 17 minute 5K or sub 35 minute 10K if this is realistic). I will be looking into incorporating tempo runs and interval training such as 200m, 400m, and 800m repeats at goal race pace or a bit faster, but to be completely honest, I’m not a track star or track expert, so I would appreciate any training advice or recommendations.

1723,1723,1723,70,"Race Report - Solo Montreal Marathon (First, Beginner)",1600624749,"***Background***

26F / 80kg / athletic background in rugby, hockey, and weight lifting. I've always been impressed and interested in endurance sports and have thought about doing a marathon for a few years now. Started with my first half marathon April 2019 with a time of 2:00:32, completed a second in August 2020 without really training and then did some inconsistent running a few times per week. I decided to commit to the Sept 20 Montreal Marathon in April 2020, after recovering from an abdominal surgery.

***Training:*** 

* March 23 - May 31 2020 10 week pre-curser base building plan (16 -&gt; 30 miles / 48km) by Dan Holme on training peaks that included general aerobic endurance lactate threshold and speed workouts. I skipped a few workouts to do other activities instead (hiking, cycling). Longest run 14.5km. I felt confident coming off  of this plan as most of the longer runs were built with a negative split finish.
* June 1 - Sept 19 2020 - 16w Beginner/intermediate Marathon plan, 4d/week, time based plan by Simon Brooker on Training Peaks. The first week's  30 min threshold test had me at a 5:20min/km (8:34/mile), which put my long runs at a suggested 6:55-7:49min/km... I ran most of them in the 6:50 - 7:10 min/km range (11 - 11.5min/mile). The program's longest run was 3 hours - which maxed me out at 26km (16miles). On my second week of taper I started to panic as I realized most of the internet seems to think 18-20 miles is better preparation... but realized Hal's program caps at 16 as well. I discussed this with Simon who was very receptive to questions and agreed it might be a tough mental battle - but suggested my goal for my first marathon should be just to finish and put time goals aside.

***The Race***

* Date: Sept 19, 2020 (original weekend for the Montreal Marathon)
* Goals:
   * A) Finish the Marathon
   * B) &lt;4h45mC) &lt;4h30m
   * D) &lt;4h15m
* Course: Ran through many Montreal landmarks. Started in downtown core, by the olympic park, Gay village and arts area, Old Port, Lachine canal, turned around and over Ile Notre Damn and Parc Gille Villeneuve, Back across Champlain Ice bridge and through Nun's island to finish at Atwater market for a cold beer. Made note of emergency bathrooms available to public despite pandemic and brought a mask with me. Not many cars Saturday 7am mid-pandemic but was stopped at traffic lights 3-4 times and stopped for bathroom once. Cops also turned on their lights and wagged their finger at me when I tried to skip a red...
* Race crew: First friend met up with me at the 6mile mark. She carried water and gels for me, and stopped after 10km. Second friend (experienced in IronMan + multiple marathons) met me at 12mile and ran the rest of the way with me! My girlfriend me me at the half as well on her bike and carried gels/water/electrolytes. A third friend met us on her bike at the 30km mark for some encouragement, and my parents were waiting at my virtual finish line with a hand crafted cardboard medal, and car to drive me home.

***How did it go?***

* The taper is SO REAL!! I had so much energy at the beginning of the race and was so excited to see my friend at the 10km mark, I was sort of distracted from pacing and checking in with myself. I calculated my marathon pace based on my slow run using a variety of methods and planned to start at 6:10/km (9:58mile) and speed up... but did the first half at a 6:04km / 9:45 mile. 
* I had a gel and 2 cliff bloks and I felt pretty good right up until I saw my second friend right before the half mark... and realized I had gone out too fast and still needed to do another 21km. My friend suggested doing a walk - run strategy to take in some food and refuel and break it up into smaller chunks. I crashed and burned my way through the next half marathon - stopping to walk a total of 13 times, mostly on the uphills. 
* I really struggled at the 27-32 k mark... the mental struggle of watching time slip away is HARD on the ego knowing there is still so long to go. I was a mix of hungry, nauseous, and thirsty but could feel fluid sloshing in my stomach. I wanted something more substantial then gels - but unfortunately race crew forgot to bring my banana at the half and only had a very pasty cliff bar. I ate half of that, 2 more gels at the 27 + 35k mark, and finished my cliff bloks which helped me finish the last 3km without stopping. I finished the Marathon strong - but at a time of 5:10:32

\-----

***The bottom line:***

* I finished my first marathon!
* Everyone is right... don't go out too hard. A Marathon is not just two 2 half marathons!
* A max run of 16miles is enough to have you complete a marathon but I think the mental practice of reaching 18-20 miles would probably helpful.
* Nutrition is no joke. I thought I practiced it properly but still struggled on race day to know what I wanted. Gels and GU /cliff blocks are nice but they don't take away the empty feeling.
* RESPECT the distance.

I signed up for a virtual half that I’m hoping to do around January. I did a half not too long ago (May I think?) and have done many in the past. Generally I do 4 to 5 days of running and 1 to 2 days of rest, and occasional cross training.

However, I started doing orange theory a few months ago and I really love it. If you’ve never heard of orange theory, it’s basically a 60 min HIIT workout that encorporates running, weights, and rowing. I tend to go three times a week, and I’ll run the other days. Usually 3-4 days a week.

I haven’t really started officially training yet because I’m unsure if I would be able to sustainably train while only running 3 or 4 days a week and also doing HIIT for three days. I could start doing HIIT twice a week and run four days so I have a day of rest?

Is this normal or is this some form of asthma?",1600618176,"Hey! So for starters I’ve (23F) been tested for asthma (just the regular lung capacity test) and they said I seemed to breathe normally. I have ALWAYS been terrible at running, but I have come to love it. The problem is... after about 2-5 minutes (depends how consistently I’ve been running) I can’t breathe. I “run” between 2-4km 2-3x a week, and essentially jog at a relatively slow pace until I can’t breathe, walk for a few minutes until my breathing slows, and then continue. I’ve had a few instances where if I pushed myself too hard I start wheezing and have to completely stop to catch my breath, but that’s usually in the spring when I forget to take my allergy medicine before running.

I also do short 20-30min strength workouts like 2-3x a week and feel like while I’m not the fittest person in the world I’m not in bad enough shape that I should be gasping for breath after running such short intervals.

I never get better than that 3-5min of running. It’s been stagnant for 3 years of off/on running (I tend to take a month off here or there when life gets busy). When I run I am able to keep a good slow, steady breathing rate through my nose, but then I get to a point where I just can’t and start gasping if I push myself past that point. I just want to know if it’s normal to suck at breathing like... forever, if I’m not running often/consistently enough, or if I should go back for more asthma testing (and/or just ask for an inhaler).",running,AmIAmazingorWhat,False,/r/running/comments/iwgmxj/breathing_problems_when_running_i_am_gasping_for/

1731,1731,1731,78,I ran my first half marathon today. I enjoyed it... and decided I’ve got no ambition to go further!,1600616680,"Hello. I’ve been in the Army for 13 years and I’ve hated running the entire time. The last 5 years I’ve been in a position where we don’t have to do PT (physical training) but we still have to take our semiannual PT test. So I’ve never been an excellent runner but I wouldn’t say I’ve been “average American” out-of-shape. 

I hopped on Higdon’s intermediate HM 2 for shits and giggles just to see how it goes. It turned out that part of the reason I’ve always hated running is because I’ve been taught you always go 100%. And that you get nothing at all out of a long slow run. So over the course of this training plan I can’t say that I enjoy running but now I feel compelled to run even on my rest days which is pretty unheard of for me. 

Today the plan culminated with the half marathon and I ended up averaging a pace that’s under 10 minutes a mile. Very happy with it. But I feel like if I want to do this again in the future, the half marathon is going to be “my race.”

Have any of you decided that you would rather focus on improving one specific race and forgo any idea of continuing to add distance? A buddy of mine at work runs ultramarathons and he thinks that it’s nuts to stop at a half.

1732,1732,1732,79,Shattered 10k - Training Journey,1600615881,"       This past Friday I went for a run and PR’d again in a 10k run. My first ever 10k was 45:47 at 203ft elevation (Dec 2019, what a much simpler time). I would come to run many 10ks again, in much different elevations though, usually at a mountain trail at about 600ft elevation. Never got close to that time since then but when quarantine started I just stopped running or doing anything, my fitness completely dropped. That was until I changed my life around and started running again. 
       My main goal was to get in shape for my pre-season trainings of HIIT and runs at the mountain trail I mentioned before. I would run just 5ks to get into the groove of things again. It started in April, at 25min, terrible runs cramping everywhere. My initial schedule was to run one day, then do body weight training the next, and repeat. 
        I did this for the entire month of May, running 14 times. June, a little less, 10 times. I wanted more, so in July I ran 23 times accumulating 100 miles (160km). By now I ran my best 5k of 21:52. I ran 15 days (&lt;4.5mi/7.2km a day) in a row to get to 100 miles which was my goal that month.  August is when my pre season started so I took it easier to prepare for it. I knew the trail like the back of my hand, the mountain is my bitch now. In the months prior, I would go by myself every Sunday to run a lap (2.02mi/ 3.25km) then that grew to two (4.04mi/6.5km) eventually three, just about 10k. 
       All this led me to where I am now. I actually PR’d nearly two weeks ago at the track at a time of 44:56. But Friday I ran 6.23mi in 42:46. There was a post recently about playing tricks on yourself to push you more. Before I started I was like, Okay just a 4 mile run. Then I got to that and was like why not 5? Okay I’m at 5 why not do 10k? So I did that and destroyed (would you consider this destroyed?) my previous time. I ran every split with an avg 6:52/mi. I was so surprised how I did it, and felt great after too. My legs had a sick pump but in a good way. 
       What to take from this? Never give and just do it. If you really want it you will succeed. I’m proud of myself to have worked hard to get here and I’m sure many of you have felt the same way at one point. It truly is the greatest feeling to reach your goal, and when you’re there you know yourself and how to get even better! 
      
I have a final question and statement. Does it matter your time despite where you run? Is my 10k PR around my town less validated than one on a track since it would be harder with literally no elevation gain or loss? Also, my 5k split during my 10k PR was 20:32 so is that a 5k PR or no?

statement: I mentioned I ran everyday for 15 days, that was a tough stretch. As I run now with days in between off, I find myself absolutely flying in runs. It must do with extra recovery between runs because before I would never be able to do what I did so consistently with this PR. But to each’s own. Ik this was a statement but what do you guys think of this?

I’ve always had a low heart rate, around 40 bpm resting and 30s in my sleep according to my Apple Watch. I hit 27 bpm and my doctor is concerned for me. I’m trying to see how normal this heart rate is given my daily running.

My doctor got me to wear a holter monitor for something unrelated (I have what feels like a lot of double beats / pvcs). The monitor has 4g and transmits heart data by cell towers to some doctors or nurses who get alerted if I am doing poorly.

So I wear this thing and typically at night it goes crazy beeping and recording ‘events’ and is just generally annoying me. Then one night at 4am the on call nurse at my doctors office tried calling my phone a few times to wake me up because my heart went down to 27 bpm as I slept.

I missed the call and she and the people who run the 4g monitoring service kept trying to call me the next day too and finally got me on the phone (bad phone service here) and they were genuinely worried about me, asking if I’m dizzy, fainting, seeing black, etc. I reassured them I feel fine apart from the PVCs but they tell me my doctor is now referring me to a cardiologist because 27 bpm is too low. They tell me to take it easy etc and schedule me for appointments with my doctor and a cardiologist coming up this week.

to make it simple, i constantly feel like i have a weight on my chest. i cant take full deep breaths and feel like i’m constantly having a panic attack and struggling to breathe (even when  I’m not.) most of it is probably due to weight as i’m in the obese category (5’4, 182lbs.)

so for when i start out running, is there any way i can somehow lessen the pain in my lungs? I’m rather active surprisingly. i work out a lot, do a lot of hard labour but usually i’m able to ignore the pain- but when i run it’s awful pain and i feel like i’m going to pass out.

Anyway, here is what I did. I have always been a runner who's in a decent shape and fitness level. Prior to setting my mind on doing it, I was normally running 15-20 kms or so per week along with some HIIT sessions. I cut my HIIT sessions, started increasing my mileage by 5 kms each week till I was doing 35-40 kms per week and stayed there. I would do 4 runs per week as follows:

-2 long runs (Didn't care about the pace, just focused on finishing the distance without stopping. Those were my adjustable runs. I initially did 7 kms/run in my first week till I was doing 13 kms/run in my last.)

-1 speed workout (Did 5 intervals of 1 km with the desired race pace or less (3'50"" - 3'58""). I would initially give myself 2 minutes of rest between intervals cutting it down gradually to just 10 seconds in my last training session. In the early weeks, I did 600m x 8 and 800 x 6.)

-1 tempo run (Ran 5 kms giving an effort of 7-8/10 which was ""comfortably hard"".)

Before any of my runs, I would do a 1-km warm up run with super easy pace and then do dynamic stretches for 3 minutes. During my last week, I did 2 speed workouts, 2 long runs and ditched the tempo one. 

Regarding my body weight, I decided to lose a couple of kilograms to ease my running. I'm a male, 5'3"" (163 cms) and I went from 136 lbs (62 kgs) to 132 lbs (60 kgs).

I plan to take some rest, maintain my fitness level and then start training for sub-40 10K, which I hear is a different kind of beast to tame.

The big difference from previous years was we had semi seeded starts. Everyone was given a rough start time based on your estimated finish time, told to seed yourself accordingly and join a lane from the queue.

Three lanes holding about 10 runners each, each lane released one runner every 10 seconds. Timing was standard bib crossing the sensor at the start, to bib recrossing at the finish after completing the course. No gun time.

I found it actually pretty awesome, since i wasn't having to leapfrog dozens of people running in groups of 5 abreast in the first 2k before i settled into pace.

It did start bunching up a little as us 10k slackers started to catch some of the 21k crew thanks to an earlier start for them and the quirks of the course, but still ran pretty smoothly. The 42k crew were semi common, but cruising.

Previous years had us loop back through and finish inside Adelaide oval. It wasn't to be this year (NO IDEA WHY__), instead we skirted the East end of the ground under the new hotel (where a strange amount of people were congregating), and sprinting up War Memorial drive back to the start line.

I’ve been running for about 5 years, and apart from 2 half marathons my routine’s mostly running at evening (7 or 8pm). Not too crazy on the mileage compared to lots fellow runners here, normally just two 5~6k runs on weekdays then a 10~13k runs on the weekend. 

Starting this week I decided to become a morning person and wake up early around 6. I was really nervous in the beginning but turned out my first two morning runs (5k) was even better than my evening runs before. It felt great to run in the early morning &amp; I did feel that boost of energy throughout the whole day. However when I ran the 10k this morning, I felt completely exhausted for the whole day and even developed a headache - which also happened in the past when I ran before lunch.

So my question is: should I keep doing my long runs at evening, because that’s what my body used to and it’s much harder for the body to adjust to the new routine?

I'm pretty psyched and I think the cooler weather helped my time.

After a warm-up lap on the track I rested a bit and read a chapter of Oliver Twist on my phone. Once I was finished I went for it. 

4 laps and a mile later I reached my biggest milestone yet: a mile under 9 minutes and a time of 00:08:41. I was exhausted but felt pretty good considering I was aiming for this goal a while now.

I've logged all my runs on my fitness tracker app and when I got home I decided to review them. Wow. I was really pleasantly surprised and realized how far I've come. I went from an 00:11:28 minute just starting out last month August to a near two minute improvement today.

 I'm pretty stoked at how much better I'm getting and can vividly recall how winded I felt after my first lap around the track the first day. I love being able to run where I want to go and never realized how out of shape I was despite doing bodyweight exercises every day.

1795,1795,1795,44,They told me fall was for PRs..,1600558708,"I started running in February, and in March set a 5k PR of 30:40. I was happy, but set my sights pretty quickly on a sub 30 minute time.  As lock down happened, and summer came, my training stalled. I ran longer distances, peaking at 6.5 miles, but never was able to get into a race mindset and stay there. I'd start too fast, pause my watch and stop. 

I read Peter Sagal's The Incomplete Book of Running. He proclaimed the 3 Gs of running: gradual (I steadily increased from 0 miles to 12-15 week), goal (I had one), and group. Ugh.  No, I'm slow, there's a lock down, and just.. Well, maybe? I wasn't making any progress on my own. 

I signed up for a 10 week trail running course at the beginning of the month. We meet twice a week: Tuesdays for drills (Hill repeats, intervals, etc.) and Saturdays for long runs. I feared being the slowest, but I found myself in a great group of people. There were 3 unofficial pace groups, with me in the middle. Everyone was kind and we wore masks and distanced. The workouts pushed me harder than I ever went on my own. I slowly noticed that my road recovery runs were much easier, yet faster. Last Saturday, I set a new longest distance at 7.6 miles. The cooler temperatures, the group, and the trails all made running so much easier. 

It was just above freezing when my group headed out this morning. Most of the fastest pace group was missing, so I ended up in front with the one faster runner there. He tried convincing me to run the 9 mile loop with him, I said no dice. I had only ran 7.5 miles the week previous, and that was my distance record. I looked at my watch and whoa--we were running at quite a clip! And I felt good! So we kept going and at 2.5 miles, I called my shot: I was going to PR my 5k. I have been trying to get a sub 30 minute 5k since March. I ran back to the rest of the group, then pushed myself forward again. 29:04 for the 3.1! Yes! I did it. Then a giant hill met me while we headed up into the trails. I finally caught up with my coach and two other runners. Our coach set the pace, and it was concerningly fast. My easy pace is a solid 10:45, and she was running 9:00 ish pace on the flats and downhills. But it felt good! Next thing I know, the 10k mark flies by and I have PR'd that.

Coach jokes that she's going to make me run the 9 mile loop. No! I refuse! My legs will fall off!

Spoiler alert: the loop ended up being 9.4 miles. I told her I wanted to round out to 10, and we did. My first double digit run.

Who the hell runs a 5k PR then 7 more miles, on trails? On global trail running day, too!

I’m 21M, 6’4”, and weigh about 180lbs if that matters. 

I do have some questions regarding this challenge though. I am a fairly active guy and have been through my life, but have been very lazy through quarantine. Is there anything I should know about consecutive running regarding injury, certain stretches, good running products to try, etc.? any advice would be appreciated.

One question I can’t find an answer to:

I take a low dose, extended release stimulant medication for ADHD. I’ve noticed that it pushes my heart rate up 5-10 beats per minute, with it being in general a bit harder to get back down to baseline aerobic levels after a hill, or just a harder-ran section. Clearly this added BPM is not created by extra effort. Elevated heart rate is a well-known side effect of the medication (even though my dose is as very low compared to most). 

Is there any reason to go slower to still fit within the usual HR zones? Or do I adjust some other way? Sometimes if I do that, I feel like I’m quite close to walking. It doesn’t seem effective. But I’m concerned if I don’t, I’ll be pushing into zone 3 far more than intended. It’s a weird dilemma.

1811,1811,1811,61,I had a shit run.,1600551019,"I had a bad run. Physically, mentally, just a shit run. I’m relatively new to running, so for anyone else starting with me, thought I’d share how It happened and what I learned from it. 

About me: 32M, a few months of running consistently after being an “I hate running” my whole life. I listened when people said to go slower/longer, and fell in love with it. I’ve been keeping things slow but steady, with my 5k 29:45, 10k 1:12:44. After running 10 miles (my longest) last weekend, I thought I’d plan my Saturday to break my 10k PR. I also ran 25 miles last week (up from an average of 15), so I knew I was pushing it in terms of overuse. 

I woke up to my alarm clock at 6am, and decided to sleep in, fully knowing it’d be hotter later (I live in Miami, so the heat and humidity are brutal after 8am). I didn’t care,  because, oh well. 

At 8 when I was finally up, I put on all my gear, including a black dri fit shirt, and couldn’t find my running hat. I didn’t grab my sunglasses, because they fog when I don’t wear my hat. 

I then started the run and looked at the temp, which was 88 degrees, and muggy AF. I didn’t have a planned route, so I just ran on some main streets not really thinking about things like shade, water fountains, etc. it was only 6 miles after all? About a quarter mile in, I started feeling a twinge in my right ankle, so I started compensating a little by trying to run on the outside of my foot. This created a little movement in my hip flexor that didn’t feel ... awesome. 

After mile 4 and nowhere close to the pace I wanted, my heart rate was around 180, and I found myself nowhere close to shade. I decided to walk for a minute, then continue. Once I started walking, I realized how much pain my hip was in. Still, a minute later I started running for another quarter mile, until I had to start walking again. 

I happened to be near a Burger King and could get some water or juice, and was happy I threw my credit card in my flip belt. Then realized I had  no mask to go in, so I stood in the drive thru, got some dirty looks, and sheepishly asked for a cup of water since I was drenched in sweat and limping at that point. 

Then I called my wife and asked if she wanted to pick me up and go get smoothies. Now I’m limping around the house with what feels like a mild hip flexor strain, and am going to be taking it easy for a few days. 

But rather than sulking in it, here’s what I learned: 

1. I’m impressing literally nobody when I’m being stubborn about the distances I’m running. 
2. I was never mentally dedicated to the run or it’s purpose, and that’s a problem. 
3. You look like way more of an idiot limping around your house than walking. Listen to your body. 
4. Wear sunscreen.  
5. Bring a mask. 
6. When I make commitments to my runs, I need to stick with them. For me, corner cutting begets more corner cutting. 
7. Plan your routes. Nothing wrong with hot runs if you prepare for them, which I did not. 
8. Be kinder to yourself. There will be more shit runs, but there’s more you can learn from them than some of the good ones. I can’t wait to get back out there.

1816,1816,1816,66,"Lessons from summer running: I finished my first (un-planned) half Marathon today, and learned so much from everyone here!",1600546564,"*Basic bg: 40M, 6', 158 lbs. I've not run in any consistent way for a long time, but I've kept in decent shape over the last 5 years by walking a lot. Started running in May of this year.*

Today, I finished a half marathon in 1:52, which was a good bit better than my goal of ""under two hours,"" which has been there for a while, but really as a generic goal that I would attempt ""some time in the future."" Never thought it'd be today!

I’ve never run that far before. Previous longest distance was 12.5 km, and mostly I have been running 10k since Aug 1st, but it just felt right!

Some lessons that I learned along the way, both through self-discovery (getting to know myself), as well as through so many excellent contributors here that I wanted to share (I've been lurking to pick up tips for a while now):

1. **Consistency is good for me!** I began running 3 km back in late May, then 5k, and never really intended to go more. However, I did keep at it 4 times per week- every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, almost without fail. This allowed me to build up slowly and the consistency was great for conditioning.
2. **Goals are useful, but be careful about watching too close and over too short of time intervals!** After I had 3k down, I thought, I should try 5k. Then, why not try 5k under 30 min. I was using a Fitness tracker app that would read out times every 1.0 or 0.5 km, and thought this was a great way to keep track. Then, one day, the app failed on me, and I started using another app without that feature. It was my best run- just run, don’t worry about anything else! I think for me, this focus was liberating, and freed myself to not think ""I need to slow down"" or ""I need to speed up."" That little think led to much better results and much more enjoyment!
3. **Run to a comfortable pace!** Rather than running faster, I just ran at what I thought felt nice. After ditching the regular pace readings, this became a lot easier- focus on what is comfortable and can be kept up. No need to feel tons of pain during the run- quite the opposite! Just enjoy the moment and keep moving!
4. Perhaps most importantly for me- **Running has kept my chronic nerve pain at bay**. I’ve not needed any pain meds since JUL 1st, and this has made a huge positive impact on my life!

Anyway, I’ve made some plots that show my progress (can't find a way to post them here, but they show that while any given run may have been slower than previous runs, the overall trend for both 5k and 10k runs went from 36 min to 25 min, and 68 min to 53 min, respectively, between JUN 1 and today). For me, this clearly demonstrates the important points for me- consistency and focus on running to what my body can take. **Stated another way, the trend is clearly toward faster times, but I’ve learned not to expect to set a PR every time out!** On days that I can’t run as fast, I just don’t- not a problem! My motivation is simply feeling good and knowing that the next challenge can be tackled, and that it’s all just a mental game with myself anyway.

This week was just ridiculous, let me tell you about a things that happened:


. Monday I had to run through a MASSIVE flock of sheep. No shepherd or anything around. They were just chilling by the river, on the trail, screaming at people.


.Tuesday AND Wednesday I saw snakes on the trails. One basically in the city centre, on in the park. I’ve never seen a snake in my cold, European country! And they weren’t even small, around 1,5 m


.Wednesday I also saw a tarantula! Same thing, not something you usually see in my country. Scared the shit out of me.



.Friday a girl was walking her very tall and stubborn horse through the city. No idea why. It turned sideways and blocked the road and everyone was just confused. Including the horse.



.Today the only non-Animal related weird thing happened. First a man started yelling at me to go faster to safe my wife (??? I’m female myself and not married ???) and then a wedding possession was just chilling on the river trail and all started clapping when I ran by. Must have been 30+ people (without masks or anything -.-)

How long: 50 days (16hrs and 13 mins)
About me: 15M, been running for about 4 months 



I’m a bit over a month into wearing them and I have to say for a pair of budget running shoes they are lasting longer than what I thought and they are still as comfortable as when I bought them. They are cushioned and have a thicker sole than the cheaper versions at Decathlon. 
They are good for mud (not excessive)or in the rain and I was easily able to wash and dry them. 
If you are going to buy running shoes from Decathlon I would recommend these but would say don’t go cheaper, Decathlon also have some pairs under £30 and having tried them on they have next to no support quite bad quality. These ones are the cheapest better quality running shoes available.
Overall I’d rate them a 7/10, they are great for beginners or for your first pair however there are much better ones out there. Great value for money, you get what you pay for.

I will be looking for my next pair in 3-4 months and will probably try out a bit more expensive pair from decathlon then so I will be able to compare and see if the Decathlon shoes are up to scratch.",running,quinnleo_,False,/r/running/comments/ivpx08/kalenji_running_shoes_review_decathlon/

I am hoping if I keep going on like this I will get better but I am feeling like after four months of consistent training I should be able to do this with a breeze? Still dying at the final laps.

Oh, and also. I feel the biggest obstacle to what makes my running bearable are the pains in my shins/ankles. I wear Hoka OneOnes.

Issue is that with some size 11s I feel like there's a bit too much ""give,"" like the shoes don't stay conformed to my feet entirely. The other day when shopping for new running shoes I tried on a size 10.5 and loved how snug it felt. No slippage, no give. Bought them. I showed them to a few people I know and they all said that they were too small, that you're supposed to have a bit more room up front in the toes. I checked online and yeah it does seem that these 10.5 shoes aren't really in line with the standard guidelines. By the usual guidelines I guess I really am a size 11. I returned the 10.5 pair. 

But I felt so nice walking around in the 10.5 pair in my apartment. I liked the snugness. But maybe I'd begin to feel that they are in fact too small if I went running in them?

Can you use your own judgement and get shoes where the toe room is admittedly a bit smaller than they say is ideal if you like it so far, or is it smart to go ahead and follow the usual rules for toe room? Have you ever bought shoes knowing they didn't have the right amount of toe? I just don't want to spend 80 bucks for more wobble shoes. It feels like neither size really works for me, I dunno.

1896,1896,1896,48,Very low active HR and getting slower,1600471551,"Bear with me this is a long post and it's 2 separate things. These have been going on for a while and I've sometimes brought them up with doctors but I wonder if anyone can relate or provide any explanation.

The main thing which is weird is that since at least the past ~3 years my running HR is often lower than normal. I have a Garmin Forerunner which reads 120 for easy/moderate pace, 130 for moderate/hard, and 145 for hard pace. In the past ~9 months I've been feeling more tired and now sometimes it reads 100 or 110. Calories burned are estimated to be about under 50 per mile, idk if that's actually accurate. Occasionally it will read something more reasonable like 140bpm or 160bpm without any more effort, and in races it has measures at 160bpm and 170bpm. I don't think it's just the watch either because I've had similar heartrates running on a treadmill or cycling on an elliptical. My resting HR has been about 45-50bpm at doctor's offices and I think that's what it reads when I check on the watch, although the ""lowest HR"" recorded goes from 30-50bpm.

I started running seriously about 4 years ago and since then I've been running almost every day (I do take days off occasionally though). I started doing 15-25mpw and gradually built up to at most about 100mpw some weeks, although I'm doing less now (~55mpw). I would stagnate over the winter but make progress over the summer, and I got up to 8min/mi easy pace and 6:30min/mi hard. Until recently, I felt like I pushed myself hard and felt DOMS even at 130bpm for 75min.

---

In October of last year I got an injury and had to take about a week off. Since then I've been running much slower and my pace has gone down - it was initially 10min/mi easy pace (instead of 8min/mi) and now it's 11min/mi and 9min/mi harder. This is except for a couple strange incidents where my pace came back: one time right before I finished running a slow marathon ironically I suddenly had the energy to run 7:30min/mi, and another time when it was freezing outside and I felt really anxious like I had a flight or fight response, I ran 11 miles at ~8:30min/mi. I definitely think I'm not trying as hard because all of my runs are easy now, but I don't know how to get myself to try, I can't find the motivation or discipline.

I'm bringing this up now because I've been slowly losing motivation to keep running, probably in part due to covid but also because I'm getting so much worse than before, and I get really bored and the boredom is getting to me. I still run every day but some days I don't do that much because I'm mentally tired. I want to be fit but I feel like I'm so lazy, and I don't know if anything's wrong with my body or if it's just in my head, and regardless how to improve.",running,armchairwarrior13579,False,/r/running/comments/ivh2x7/very_low_active_hr_and_getting_slower/

These two things have made running difficult for me (I could manage a 5-minute mile back in my younger days and I just stumbled through a 13-minute jog today)

So for the shoe issue...men’s size 11 length but the width gauge at the store bottoms out about 1/8” before touching the side of my foot.

In 2018 while running I tore something in my knee and was down for a long time.  I tore something in my hip/groin in 2019 doing the same thing.  I saw a doctor about both, they suggested toughing it out and doing stretches while it healed and continuing afterwards.  It took months to recover from each and I failed my goal of 180 miles a year both times around the 70 miles mark.

It's 2020 and I've been running pretty successfully this year.  I'm well ahead of the course on beating the goal I set in both 2018 and 2019 at 140 miles.  To get me there during the first 80 or so miles I've had to wear an OTC knee brace.  Now I'm wearing OTC shin splint socks regularly.

1930,1930,1930,82,"Update: 6 months later and 10,000+ Running Plans downloaded",1600448495,"6 months ago down the road, 10,000+ plans downloaded, and I just wanted to give r/running an update. First off I want to give a HUGE shoutout to the r/running community. If I could give you all gold I would.

I initially made a post on Reddit back in March offering to write free 8-10 week running plans for people during Covid ([https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/foh1j3/i\_will\_write\_you\_a\_free\_running\_plan\_for\_the\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/foh1j3/i_will_write_you_a_free_running_plan_for_the_next/)). There were countless charities at the time and instead of trying to throw money at all of them, I thought this could be another small way I could give back during Covid and could enjoy doing it. I've been fortunate enough to have incredible coaches and mentors and I feel it's always important as runners to pay it forward. I expected maybe 5-6 response and instead the post received about 1,500 responses on the thread, direct message, and chat. There were incredible stories and I wish I could write plans for all of them, but it just wasn’t going to happen in this lifetime, or many.

Rather than just pick 5 or 6, I put together various customizable training plans for 1 mile and 5k. I then expanded this to include customizable 1 mile/5k intro to running plans (similar to C25k), 10k plans, and half marathon plans. To comply with r/running's rules, I threw them up available to download for free on my Google Drive. In addition to this, I put them on a website to house all the information in one place and make it easier to update. This was all free of charge with no ads, email, or anything required.

Over the past 6 months, over 10,000 plans have been downloaded from the site. I don’t believe I’m able to see the number of downloads from the Google Drive so it's just the number from the website (excluding a 3-week period where I had no information provided). I have also since had issues with my hosting services listing the number of downloads and won't be able to have a definitive number (or one at all) going forward.

I still get a few emails, DMs, chat messages each day. This includes questions about the plans, asking if I’ve written marathon or other plans, providing an update on improvement/PBs, or asking if I was still writing custom plans (from my initial post in March). It’s honestly been incredible and inspiring to hear so many stories and realize these free and relatively basic plans can make a small difference.

**Monetization / Transparency:**

I was initially accused by 1 person as using this as an effort to monetize. So in the name of transparent, here is a description of the costs/funds raised:

The site doesn’t require email to download, doesn’t have ads on the site or the plans themselves, and relies solely on donations to keep it running. I do have Google Analytics, but that’s mores for my own entertainment and getting to see what states/countries have visited the site and seeing there’s x amount of users checking it out right now. For a month period, every state except North Dakota had visited the site. I finally broke down and posted on Twitter if someone from North Dakota visited the site, I would write a custom plan for them. Someone from ND did indeed respond and we’ve now had 6 users from ND - which actually moves ahead of SD(3 users) and WY(2 users) on the States visited list. Theres tens of runners out there apparently :)

The site has a few Amazon links to recommended products that earns a *tiny* percentage if someone clicks through and purchases, but I have limited that to items that I personally use and recommend. It’s also for user convenience and I actually encourage users to purchase from local running stores and support them rather than through our link.

In addition to donations, I recently offered to write plans for a small donations to keep the site operational. If it got to a point where there were too many (I don’t see that being the case), then I will shut that option down. I want to ensure its limited since I already have a job and have recently gone back to grad school as well. The goal isn’t to become a full time running plan writer, but instead actually enjoy being involved in coaching as a manageable side hobby. I’ve previously coached high school, college, and privately. These plans allow me to continue coaching indirectly by writing plans and staying engaged in the running/coaching world - albeit to a lesser degree.

Here is the monetary breakdown:

Money in:

* PayPal Donations: $262.78 (fees excluded)
* Cryptocurrency Donations: $0 (lol. I thought offering crypto donations was a good idea)
* Amazon link clickthroughs: $11.63

Total: $274.41

&amp;#x200B;

Money Out:

* Hosting Services 7 months (paid through October 15th): $140 ($20/month)
* Domain and Privacy Paid through March 2023: $55.96
* Logo Design/Purchase (Fiverr): $24
* Note: The money out excludes the initial domain/privacy/etc which I had purchased.

Total: $219.96

Current Balance: $54.45

The above includes a current outstanding order for a training plan, which I won’t use the donation funds to purchase anything until it has been completed in full. Once completed, that will fund the hosting which I try to buy in bulk to cut down cost.

**What’s Next?**

Here are some things that I hope to have accomplished in the next few months, some of which I have been saying for months:

* Addition of Marathon Plans
* Military and LEO 1.5m - 2mile Training Plans (more challenging than I initially thought considering the various branches/requirements and if it’s an try requirement or ongoing physical fitness).
* Allow option for km or miles in the plans (this is really an easy fix that I should do soon).
* Create a secondary plan breakdown that may be easier for some to read: Day by Day breakdown with paces.
* Mobile version: This should be very high priority since over 55% of the traffic on the site is via Mobile, yet the plan really requires Desktop to fully utilize the plans. Mobile integration is also the most costly and where I have the least experience.
* Continue building out our Top-10 lists for each event. This can only be done as users submit their times after completing the plan.

**Alternative Monetization Streams:**

What are some possibilities to ensure enough funds to keep the site operating in the event that donations dry up? Some initial ideas that come to mind (in order) are:

1. Merchandise through a third party.
2. Incorporate relevant ads into the free running plans (placed on the spreadsheet itself)
3. Partner with full vetted coaches who I trust and offer training/discounts if someone is looking for a full-time coach.
4. Write articles on running gear that include Amazon links to products that I fully endorse (never write an article or include for something I don’t believe in. Always be fully transparent about what’s promoted.
5. Google Ads: This is if all else fails. I really don’t want to include ads on the site but need to think worst case if no money is coming in.

I really don’t like the ad model and I would really have full control over them. I'd prefer to only promote items/materials/coaches that I actually use and trust. I would never want to be deceptive or be responsible for peddling some BS I don’t believe in.

I also don’t want/need peoples emails/information at all. I don’t believe we need to track the customer’s emails, create mailing lists, etc. I would rather keep it as easy as possible for people to access the site without being bombarded with ads and download the plans without having to provide any information.

**Take-aways:**

This has been an incredible journey. I can’t thank the r/running community enough. The site is self-sustainable for the most part and over 10,000 of my plans have been downloaded with users from all 50 States and allegedly 103 different countries. It’s been amazing to interact with people and hear their individual stories and running journeys - whether completely new or years in the making. I sometimes get tagged incorrectly on posts and sometimes it doesn’t pop up on my notifications, but some of the awesome posts I’ve seen include:

I also love getting feedback via Reddit or email with your Top-10 submissions after accomplishing your new PB. Or just feedback (even critical feedback) on the plans.

As I’ve said from the beginning, there may be better coaches and better plans out there. However, the goal here was to provide easily accessible and solid customizable training plans to people for free. I initially thought this would before just a few people, but it turned into thousands and maybe even tens of thousands. I hope this inspires others who want to give back in their own way.

Not everything needs to be a business and about making money. In fact, sometimes that takes the enjoyment out of it. I can truly say, it’s still enjoyable at this time and hope that continues for the next 6 months and however long this lasts.

1931,1931,1931,83,Garmin Forerunner 645 not charging - solution: heat it up,1600447625,"My forerunner 645, bought in May 2018, started to show issues with charging some months ago. The watch would not start charging once cable was connected. After trying a couple of times, rebooting the watch, I got it to charge, and I didn't think more of it.

Then 2 weeks ago I couldn't get it to charge at all, and after some debugging with other cables and watches, it was clear the watch was the issue. I still managed to get it to charge sometimes (after cleaning it, letting it dry in the Sun etc), but not consistently.

I contacted Garmin support to see how to resolve the issue. They came back with an offer to exchange it for a refurbished watch, at a price of ~110€, giving 90 days warranty. 
I hoped for a better offer, as you can buy a refurbished one with 1 year warranty for~$199.

In the mean time I figured out, relatively reliable, how to get the watch to charge again:
After a run, post clean, when it would not charge directly, I will heat it up with a hairdryer to ~50°C (~122°F), and then it'll charge again. My guess of the problem is that there is a faulty connection somewhere inside the watch. 

Not sure how good this is for the battery itself, though it allows me to use the watch a bit longer while pondering to either go for an upgrade, or taking on the Garmin offer.

in case your Garmin Forerunner 645 is not charging, a solution might be to heat it up for a while, and then try again to charge it.

Before lockdown, I couldn't run for more than a minute without agonizing shin-splints. These seem to have gone away now that I have some good running shoes suited to me and I've been following a C25K progression. Unfortunately, that progression become unsustainable in Week 6 and I started to fail my runs.

My best run was around 20 minutes continuous running at 9kph (sorry I don't do pace, I only look at the speed on the treadmill...) and my goal is a sub-30 5k (10kph). **Even without this continuous run, the most I have ever ran using intervals is around 20 minutes.**

From here, I've designed a 3-day template that has:

**Day 1:** Interval runs at 10.5kph (sets of 4 to 5 minutes) with weekly total running time increasing.

**Day 2:** Longer intervals, 8-10 minutes, at a lower speed with the aim of building total endurance - the total running time on this day should be around 40 minutes.

**Day 3:** One continuous run for as long as I can manage at 10kph.

1. Day 2... is this the right way to go about this, or should I be trying to get my body used to moving for the full 30 minutes no matter how low the speed is?
2. Is there a better way to program Day 3? Instead of running perhaps 15-20 minutes at 10kph, should I try 2x10 minutes or 3x8 minutes with small rests (\~1min)?
3. Total running volume... it's currently around 15km / week with this program. Is this enough for accomplishing my goals?

1955,1955,1955,8,How do you guys track your pace/time and distance during a run?,1600421371,"Hi there!

Let me just quickly share my experience which will explain what I meant by this title.

I'm using an Apple Watch (Series 5, the most basic version with GPS only) and most of the time I run with the watch only, I leave my iPhone at home. However, when I take the phone with me, I notice there's a pretty big discrepancy in the measurements, and I'm not sure which device to trust.

For example, I have this standard route I run every day, so there's a very little chance for human error, because I have dozens of tracked workouts with the same results. Anyhow, when I run with my watch only, it is 8.42km, but when I take my iPhone too (so they're paired), it is exactly 8.00km. Obviously, that difference affects everything else, especially the pace. What I also noticed is that the watch updates pace less frequently when in close proximity to the phone, compared to watch alone.

I'm thinking it has a lot to do with how GPS works on both devices and that watch probably defers to the phone when they are in range. To make it more complicated, I don't think that the inaccuracy is even consistent, but that it depends a lot on the curvature of the path too. I feel like the watch is tracking my every step, while phone is trying to locate me, if that makes sense, so I guess there's less discrepancy when I run straight, e.g. a long street.

Anyways, I'm not a pro, but I started doing 5k and 10k runs and I want my results to be as accurate as possible for proper comparison with other people. Like, if I run a 10k with the watch only and I actually ran only 9.55km, I'm tricking myself into thinking I had better results, and that's very annoying.

I'm curious to read about your experiences with technology. Which device do you trust?

**Background**

I've played various sports (mainly Football/Soccer and Aussie rules) most of my life (28M/173cm/74kgs/AUS) but I've always relied on my short distance running and always hated the idea of running non-stop for more than 5 minutes. People would say I was ""fit"" because of all the sports I love playing whether its a pick up game of indoor or a proper outdoor game. However I always held a belief that I wasn't truly fit though because I couldn't/wouldn't push myself to run to improve my fitness.

I didn't play outdoor football in 2019 because I wasn't enjoying it so I basically did no exercise whatsoever until September when I realised I needed to get back into gym. I had always liked the idea of doing a C25K program but I had not completed it at least 5 times but I tried again last October, lasted 3 weeks before I stopped and stuck with weight training because gains is life.

I had made the decision to get back to play outdoor again for 2020 (due to heaps of persistence from my old teammates) and got stuck into preseason and boy, I was blowing out of my ass real easily. Enter COVID in March and the ensuing lockdowns that we all partook in obviously put my return to a sudden halt. I thought, I literally have no excuse to not work on my fitness anymore so I found a C210K program on an app and completed that in 8-10 weeks. Getting through all the milestones of going from walk run intervals to being able to run for 40 minutes straight in week 7 is still one of my biggest highlights. By the end of that program, I ran 10K in 1:02:46 which I was 50/50 about as I was aiming to crack under an 1hr but ecstatic that I ran 10K straight with no walking.

&amp;#x200B;

**Training**

My mate and I were both hooked on running (he is doing a separate program written up by his physio because he got shin splints from running too much too early) so I was looking for what to do next whether a 10K program or a HM program. Started going through this subreddit and came across a few posts mentioning u/free_running-plans and his plans on his website so I had a look, liked what I saw and downloaded the HM program. I got 3 weeks into it and then Melbourne decided to enter a second wave of COVID infections and we were placed into Stage 4 lockdown where we are only allowed 1 hour of outdoor exercise a day. Seeing as my long runs on Saturday were close to an hour for 6 miles, I knew the added miles in the following weeks would push me way past my hour so I made the decision to drop to the 10K program.

I followed the plan as best as possible as it was set out in a way that was easy to understand. The intervals were heaps of fun as it was a great change up from regular running. The week 4 5K TT arrived and I was nervous if I could actually run it under 30 mins as my PR at the time was 30:50 but I had a bit of confidence due to the fact I ran a 2 mile easy run balls out by mistake in 18 mins. That 5KTT was completed in 27:15, I was spent but over the moon with that time. 

I think from there, that TT gave me the full confidence in the program and in myself as a runner. The biggest ""OH"" moment though came when I was finally able to get an answer about what the difference between an easy pace and tempo pace as I was always confused by the answers online. Once I got my answer in week 5, I realised I had been running my easy runs at 6:10 min/k when I should have been running them at 6:50-7:20 min/k lol

The drop in pace made a massive difference and for the first time ever, I was enjoying my long runs on the Sat mornings (I run at 5pm during the week) when previously I had always had my least enjoyable runs on Sat mornings. By workout 7B (4x1 mile with 4 min recovery), I was confident I could beat 1hr for my 10K. 

I ran my 10K TT yesterday in the same 3.5K walking path I've walked basically everyday since mid March. 

I got my Spotify playlist optimised with some absolute tunes for the last 20 mins of the run, tried to eat lunch which I didn't finish due to nerves (i've never been able to eat much before a game due to nerves). 

The first 2 kms were fine as they were a bit quicker the my tempo pace, the hardest part of my run were splits 3-6 where I felt I was unable to get into a rhythm or actually try and maintain a negative split (btw I decided to do negative splits for the first time ever on this run, just more overthinking for myself haha). By the 7th and 8th split, I had got comfortable as I was over the hump and I knew that I could run this out. The 9th split started well but I clearly died in the ass by the end as my legs were getting even heavier. I made a decision in my last split to run balls to the wall and it hurt but I knew that if I did I might be able to beat my great outcome goal of 58 mins. Seeing under 57 mins on watch made my legless walk home feel amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Take away**

* Even if you think your easy pace is easy and you've been able to maintain conversations with your running mate, run even slower! I can't begin to tell you how much more enjoyable my long runs have become!
* You do you! I see a lot of people running on the same track as me and my pace is clearly below average as most people run past me but I know that I'm competing only against myself from yesterday.
* Thanks to the worst lockdowns since WW2, I have gone from not being able to run more than 5 mins straight to running 10K in under 57 minutes in 6 months and running has become something I really love doing.
* This subreddit has a lot of gold and I've picked up little tips and advice by searching for answers in this sub, so thank you everyone!
* Definitely give u/free_running-plans and his [website](https://freerunningplans.com/) a look, I highly recommend it!

Now that it is spring, I'm leaning towards doing the HM program next now that we roadmap to reopen Melbourne but I might give myself a week of recovery easy runs before I start the new program.

1975,1975,1975,28,How the heck am I supposed to run slower?,1600377371,"My question is primarily about form.

I've been running/training for about 3 years now. In high school and college I did track and field - but the field part, jumps, throws and hurdles. I was then, and am now, a poor endurance runner. I however also like to swim and bike, so in the past few years I've gotten into triathlons. This has forced me to focus on my running more. 

Pretty much every training plan I've used involves zone 2 runs. I went and got one of those professional lactate threshold test - and my threshold pace was somewhere around 11:00 per mile, which makes my zone 2 pace around 13:00 or slower depending on the weather. I am physically incapable of 'running' that slow.

I've got good form when I sprint or when I run something quick like a 5k. But when I try and stay in zone 2, I'm doing some awful shuffle/walking hop where it feels like I'm going to hurt myself. No matter what I do I cannot keep my heart rate down. If I'm doing any thing that looks remotely like 'running' my heart rate ends up outside of my zone 2 pretty quickly - within a minute. I can walk and stay at a low heart rate forever. When I do a zone2 run it ends up looking more like intervals - 60 second run, followed by a short walk to get the HR down and repeat. 

I've been doing this for three years now and I'm starting to get discouraged. I run two to three times a week and I haven't improved at all. I've knocked a couple minutes off my half marathon and about 30 seconds off my 5k, but my times are way, way below average to start. I've followed different training plans and even worked with a coach. Everything seems to hinge on being able to do these zone2 runs but I can't figure it out.

In March 2020, my BMI was 33. I told myself I would just start walking to lose weight. I did that everyday for two weeks, then I started to add light jogs. Here's how I've kept track, building a little on each until I reached where I am today - a sub 28 5K and sub 60 min 10k, and a BMI of 27:  


1. I started walking
2. Then I added slow jogging
3. Then I started to walk, run, walk
4. Then I introduced pre-run drills and occasional post-run stretching
5. Then I started to research proper running form and breathing, and proper nutrition
6. Then I started going on runs that were focused solely on developing form
7. Then I started to track my runs (i.e. pace, HR, distance) but didn't  review my stats holistically
8. Then I started to research barefoot/minimalistic running and training
9. Then I purchased a new pair of minimalist running shoes
10. Then I focused on building up lower body strength through various calisthenics exercises and minimalist runs
11. Then I started to run and shorten walking distances until i could run 5K+
12. Then i started to incorporate warm-up and cool down routines in my runs
13. Then I started to review my stats holistically (weekly mileage, VO2Max, pace, hear rate)
14. Then I signed up for Strava for the competitive aspect with others
15. Then i bought a pair of conventional running shoes to increase mileage
16. Then I started tracking and increasing weekly mileage by 10%
17. Then I started a 5K training plan
18. Then I increased my running from 4x a week to 6x a week.

23 male uk here. Been running casually for about 3 years now (not very consistent but im not unfit). So im currently in a really hot humid country and when i first arrived here i was doing 4-5k daily (untimed, best effort runs) for no other reason than to just maintain a base level of fitness. I test myself with 1.5mile runs (i'm in the military, and thats how they gauge your cardio and its nice to compare to everyone else you know to compare how fit you are in general, and a good way to see increments). The pass mark is 10 min 30, but realistically you want to be under 10 minutes. My fitness on arriving here and doing those 5k runs was about 9 min 50 for 1.5mile.  


After 1 and half months i started doing calisthenics. For those that don't know its just pure body weight exercises with concentration on form rather than reps (simply put). During this time i totally neglected running, not going for a single run, but i did a lot of circuits that contained burpees, mountain climbers ect and i found this stuff very cardio intensive. I also ate really strict. I have been doing that for about 2 months up to now.   


So today, after 2 months of not running, i decide to test my base level of fitness to see where im starting at. I end up running an 8 minute 17 second 1.5 mile! which is extremely fast for me! I really cannot grasp how or what ive done to attain this. All i can put it down too is my core is massively stronger and i have quite a bit less body fat (not that i was fat to begin with).

So I just initiated a return for a pair of Nike Flyease 5 extra wide shoes. The reason for getting a wide shoe is that on top of having rather wide feet, I also have a bunion right next to the left and right pinky. The toe box on the shoes above is perfect, but the middle of the shoe isn't wide enough. I also have this unusal problem with my feet; the left shoe felt great, no hot spots, but on the right foot the inside of my foot is stepping over and just outside the midsole foam, creating a hot spot that made me nope out of this shoe almost immediately. Basically, the toe box is just right in terms of width, but the shoe then gets really narrow towards the middle. Heelbox is fine. I do pronate a bit and these shoes had glued in insoles, so that didn't allow me to use the inserts I have at all.

Ideally, I'd like a shoe that has a wide toe box AND a wide waist.

The past few weeks have been hour long walks, walks with a weight vest, or hour long run/walks in 3 minute intervals. MOST of the run/walks have been on a treadmill but the walks and today's run/walk has been outside. 

I've had problems with the skin opening up on my big toes in the past so I started putting a pice of sports tape or band-aid on them. Recently I discovered the joy of putting tape on all my hot spots.

Today was a 5 mile run/walk, and when I took the tape off I found these fissures. Thats a lightly calloused area and I *hope* those are at a depth above the skin line (they don't hurt to touch or push on), but I've never had a problem right there and am concerned about how it happened. A few factors I've considered (and you may say ""yeah, correct all these things) are...

-Regular cotton socks (i ordered a pair of running socks a few days ago) maybe letting my feet get too moist and just not much of a barrier of protection.

-I run in Adidas Utra Boosts, and they don't have a lot of running miles but they're my daily shoes and are probably not too far from end of life. I have a pair of hoka bondi 4 that might have 30 miles of running on them that I can switch to.

I took some long vacations during December 2019 and the start of 2020 was not great. I live in the east coast and our winters are always cold. So I usually don't run as much as Spring-Fall seasons. I put around 15 lb while in quarantine. I'm usually at 225 lb and by May I was in 240 lb. So I started running again. I run a little during may and started to pick it up in Jun. My first 5k in Jun was 36:16 min from there I just added more volume, at this moment I'm running around 40 km a week trying to get to 50 km a week by the end of the year. I lost a lot of weight I'm at 214lb at the moment and this is what I wanted to share yesterday finally I did 5k in 24:56 min. It was a fresh day around 68F I usually have a slow first km around 6 min, but yesterday I started with a 5:11 on the first km so I knew I had chance. I have been trying to hit under 25 for a month now the closest I got was 26:18. So back to the run the second km was the fastest I ran it in 4:53 min, I started feeling confident that I was going to make it because usually my fastest km in a 5 km run is the 3rd one, surprisingly my 3rd km was the second slowest I marked 5:00 min. So at this moment I just decided to go for it km number 4 was 4:56 the last km I was breathing through my mouth and I started to felling tired but I keep going and finish the last km in 4:56 as well. With a total of 24 min 56 seconds. It felt great I know 5k under 25 is a piece of cake for most people in this sub but was a personal milestone compared with the first 5k of this year.

Any help with this sounds be greatly appreciated. I started running in lockdown to get healthier and lose weight. I've really fallen in love with in and I keep adding just a few more minutes every week (basically extending the concept of C25K).  I recently hit the 80 minute mark and have been trying to do 2 shorter 5k runs and a longer run every week. In the couple of weeks, however, I've noticed a big blister developing on the bottom of my foot, just ahead of the arch on the inside of my foot. It doesn't actually hurt, but I could definitely feel it more when I was running. I've laid off running this week and it's helping up, but I'd really like to prevent blisters on the first place.

How do you prevent/treat blisters on the bottom of your foot? I've been wearing Runderwear double layer socks, had my feet measured and got an extra wide pair of Brooks running shoes a few months ago (fantastic fit) and I've even been using chamois cream on the area where the blister is, but to no avail. Am I just too sweaty? Are my feet swelling and causing it? It only develops on runs longer than an hour.

2077,2077,2077,31,I want to do it. I want to run a half marathon. But I have a lot of weight to lose. Any tips? 28F,1600288930,"Ok so I am very active in kickboxing and weight lifting and kinda always have been. Before two kids I was thin but even then I hated running. The most I could get myself to run was a 10k.

I gained way too much with back to back pregnancies and am just in the obese range now for BMI. It just hit me that my youngest will be four years old in two weeks and geez it’s been way too long since I was happy about my body.

So since COVID left us with one income and gyms closed I tried running. I don’t know why but it just ignited something in me and I am addicted! It got me to actually want to diet and I want to run a half marathon.

Ok so knowing all that what is a realistic timeframe considering I’m in the obese range? I’ve been seeing great results and losing about 2-4 pounds a week. At this rate I should be in a BMI less than 28 in 12ish weeks. 

My thought was 5K race on Halloween. Likely a virtual event.

10k race in December. Half marathon by my birthday in march 2021. 

Sound too crazy? Most plans I see online say you can train in 12 weeks but I figure give myself time to lose weight so it’s not so hard on my joints. Anyone use this goal to lose weight or get in shape? What was your timeline?

As of now I do a 3.6 jog/walk about Four times a week. I walk a half mile, take 15 minutes to run 1.3 miles, the way back I take more like 18 minutes to run 1.3 miles and walk the last half mile. Then I go home and while warm do 15 squats and then 40 crunches and 40 push-ups split in three sets. I’m trying to get more running and less breaks in before adding more distance.

Sorry for the long post. I’m just asking what’s realistic because I’ve never had to lose weight before! Also would love to hear your favorite running plans and all the gear you use. Thanks so much! I’m excited!

2 years ago I started running for about 1 months or 2, and then suddenly stopped due to lack of motivation, which was stupid by me, 

I started running again 1 week ago, note that for 2 years I had stopped all physical activity/sports, etc.

Since I have started running again, I have set a goal of running 5km without stopping, sadly I have yet to complete it...

On my first run I was able to run 3km/2miles without stopping, then walked a bit and completed the 5km distance.

Since then, the farthest that I can go without stopping is like 2km/1 mile, lol, then I'd walk, run a bit again, walk again until I'd complete the 5km distance.

I am unable to understand if it's my physical condition that is making me  unable to complete this distance without interruption, or my mental state, because as I said, on that first day of running I completed 3km, and after running every day for more than a week now, I am surprisingly unable to make this distance again without stopping.

This is for a couple of reasons, but the main one is that I feel like asphalt is more responsive. I like to consider myself a serious recreational runner, meaning I give my all but my all tends to be about 7:00 per mile for long/easy and 6:30 for tempo. Mentally, it kills me if I take a 5 mile run and have a pace of 7:20 per mile, and that always seems to happen when I'm not dirt.

At the beginning of summer I started running in the morning to avoid too much heat but started noticing that around 2pm I would start to feel awful. This seemed to be a trend on most days that I assumed was just due to the increased temperature and sun. Today it was finally under 50 for my morning run of 3.5 miles and come 1:30pm I feel terrible again. Just an overall exhaustion and almost feverish feel. 

I hate the idea of switching to afternoon running again now that I'm used to getting it done in the morning but if it keeps up like this, even with the change in weather, I'm going to have to give it a shot again.

Any ideas? I had someone suggest I might not be breathing properly but I feel like I've read up on that quite a bit due to some initial issues with side cramps. I recently did get a heart rate monitor and my heart rate seems rather high even when I'm running 10 minute miles so again, not sure if that's something playing into it. 

I would love to start training for a half but due to how awful I feel, I usually only run twice a week. The other days I do HIIT, stationary biking or light lifting and never feel so exhausted later in the day.",running,Beckitt3,False,/r/running/comments/iu0u5v/feel_like_crap_6_hours_after_run/

Hi everybody! 

I'm working on a training plan for a solo half marathon this November, so I'm puttering around the interwerbz trying to find a decent training plan. 

I ran a solo half in June and finished in 2:10, but bonked at mile 9-10. So I'm hoping to improve my time and run all the way this time around. I loosely followed the [Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 half marathon plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/intermediate-1-half-marathon/). 

I'd love to incorporate some workouts into my weekly plans, but I've seen varying suggestions all over and I'm not sure what would work for me. I know there's no one size fits all, but I would love to have some input! 

I saw in [this article](https://www.podiumrunner.com/training/run-three-times-a-week/) that we should include 3 key workouts every week - speed, hills, and long run (and maybe a tempo run too). 

But isn't that too much? Shouldn't a majority of our runs be easy with 1 or 2 hard days? I saw [somewhere](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/motivation/a27718661/what-is-80-20-running/) that 80% of the runs should be easy and 20% should be hard? 

There's just so many plans out there it's hard to find one that would work well for me or are too complicated. 

For reference, I usually run around 20 miles a week across 3-4 days and would be happy to bump it up to 30, 35 across 4-5 days if needed. I also do 1 or 2 bike rides of around 15 miles (30 total) weekly as my cross training. And I sprinkle in a trail run here and there every once in a while. 

So any advice you may have would be greatly appreciated.

2. It doesn’t seem to be related to exhaustion- it happened 8k into a run on the weekend but I carried on after and ran to 21k without getting too tired (happened again every 5k after the 8k though). This said though it never happens until I am some way into a run (usually between 8-15k)
3. I didn’t have this problem for the first few years I ran - developed a few years ago 
4. It doesn’t seem to be related to shoes - have tried a couple of pairs and also insoles. There wasn’t any change in it
5. There isn’t any pain in my foot or other muscles when it happens - no cramp pain or anything 

Any ideas? I spoke to a physio who wasn’t particularly interested - they suggested calf stretches which I do but hasn’t helped.

The shoes have a bluetooth connection that gives feedback throughout runs and coaching tips through the UA app. When I first started running, every couple of minutes, I would get the message ""your cadence is below target range, take shorter, faster steps and maintain pace"". My cadence was about 150 to 165. By 3km into a run, the robot lady in my headphones would give up on me and tell me ""your cadence is still below target range I'll check again later in the run"".

I wanted to turn off the cadence warning because it was so annoying. 180 steps per minute felt like sprinting on the spot. I tried taking very short steps as much as possible but I got so puffed I couldn't maintain it for more than a minute.

I read all the coaching tips on the app, I did the exercises the app recommended, I kept trying to increase my cadence (usually I run 3x 5km runs per week). I started to occassionally hit 180spm and had a few runs with 10% of my run in the target cadence, I finally heard ""your cadence is now in the target zone, keep going"". It took 2 and a half months to get my first 5km run with an average cadence of 180spm, now 2 months after that I've finally gone an entire run without a single cadence warning, 99% in the target range.

I felt like 180spm was impossible, it seemed like only professional runners could achieve that and I just go for jogs, now I run at 180spm consistently.

I've had foot injuries in the past, I've had to stop running for several weeks in a row through my 5 month running journey. I put that down to me taking longer strides than I need to.

In March, I picked up running because I simply couldn’t bear to sit inside my apartment any more while quarantining. And by running, I mean mostly walking while forcing myself to jog for a minute at a time, and occasionally bending over to hack up half a lung. 

I’m still not great now, but I run 3-4 times a way, averaging 3-4 miles each time. Still run/walk intervals, but more running than walking, and my pace has gone from about a 21:00 mile (hardly faster than walking) to about 16:00, although it dips closer to 13:00 when I’m really feeling myself. Nowhere near the elite folks you see in this sub, but a far cry from the kid who couldn’t run a full mile in high school.

When I started running, I laced up a clearance pair of Adidas I’d bought at Marshall’s months prior and tossed in my closet. The sucked - it felt like there was nothing between me and the pavement, which I hated, and they pinched my toes something awful - but the pain in my chest and legs was always worse, so I could tune it out. Not the case anymore; I can run long and steady enough that when I got a groove going, it would be my foot pain that would make me slow down, and it got to a point where it was unbearable for any longer.

So, terrified of being judged for being a fatty in a running store, I sought out some help in finding a better pair at a local storefront, and the experience was gamechanging! It was so helpful, I learned a lot, and for the first time in about 6 months, I’m actually excited to run (rather than begrudgingly lacing up because I know it’s good for me). After trying on about 10 pairs - all of which fit better than my existing pair. I ended up leaving with a pair of amazingly comfy Hoka One One Bondi 7’s, and a pair of custom insoles - I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself realizing that I’d never believe it if you told me 5 years ago that I’d drop $230 at a running store. 

I went for a very easy run when I got home - just 2 miles, between 15:00 and 16:00 mile pace - and OH MY GOD. What??? I was faster without even trying? My stride feels longer?

I've always wanted to do a half marathon and I trained for one a few years back until the weekend of the race my whole family got sick and three of us were signed up for the race. We didn't go. Flash forward to yesterday and it's 3 years later, I have done 5 runs in the last 12 months and none of them were over 6 miles or ~10km. I had set a 6 mile goal on my nike running app and was feeling good when it said I had reached my goal so I decided to keep running. When I hit 8.5 miles I could feel the burn setting in but I also started considering trying to hit that 13.1 marker. By mile 9 my mind was set and there was nothing anyone could do to stop me. By mile 12 my legs felt like they were going to disintegrate. But alas they didn't and I made it back to my home, where I have now been stuck, unable to walk up stairs.

In June I donated blood at an event and about a week later I got an email with info on the vitals they took. When I saw my blood pressure I was shocked. I was pre-hypertension. This was the shock I needed to make a change in my lifestyle. I started making better choices and exercising regularly. 

Being an overweight guy and running was not a good mix for me. I despised running and could barely manage half a mile before feeling depleted. I sought encouragement from this sub and found inspiration in people sharing their stories. 

I decided the best course of action for me would be to have a goal to work towards (because I've done this weight loss journey about a dozen times before but always ended up quitting.) So, I signed up for a 5K. I started training for the run and pushing myself each day. 

Today I am excited to post that this morning I ran my first 5K and did it in under the goal time I set for myself!

My legs are hurting but I could not be more proud of myself. I owe a lot to this sub and the people who have encouraged me. I can't wait to sign up for my next race and push myself even further.

i'm currently looking for a treadmill recommendation in the range 500-1500€ ?

Does anyone have good experience or knowledge? The web is full of spam :(

**requirements**:

* very important: it needs to be very compact (\~20-30cm depth folded); example: [https://resources.sport-tiedje.com/bilder/darwin/extended-usps/tm30/tm30-usps2.jpg](https://resources.sport-tiedje.com/bilder/darwin/extended-usps/tm30/tm30-usps2.jpg)
* it needs to be as silent as possible
* good damping
* 16 km/h (10mph) - 20 km/h (12mph) would be nice for HIIT training
* robust 
* available to order in germany
* should fit for my weight (75kg = 165 lbs)  and size (172cm = 5,6 ft) 

everything else and all the comfort features are not important

i was already inspecting these options so far: 

* Darwin TM 30 -&gt; kind of weak (1.5 PS), seems to have good damping and very compact if folded; best candidate so far, but i can't find enough reliable reviews

My wife and I have each taken leaps in our running this year, so after talking about it we have many reasons why we want the ability to stay inside and get our miles in. Normally we'd be okay with gym memberships simply for winter months, but COVID also changes things.

I've seen similar questions posted before, but a quick search didn't turn anything terribly helpful, so here I am.

I used to run a LOT. I got a Fitbit Charge HR, and it got me obsessed with moving like nothing else in the past ever had. I was hitting the treadmill or running my neighborhood every day, and between the Fitbit official app and RunKeeper, I had a decent record of my progress built up.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm in the worst shape of my life. I had a medical issue come up in 2017 that knocked me on my butt for a while, and I'm only just in a health/headspace to get back into running. Due to my health condition, however, it has become necessary for me to track my runs.

Back when I was running all the time, RunKeeper was really the best (and kinda the only) app for tracking.

Now, though, there's Strava, Nike Run Club, Native workout apps (I'm on iOS so I've got Workouts on my Apple Watch), and RunKeeper is still around.

Im a male 34 year old that have been running on and off for about 10 years. I had an initial goal of running a 10k which i did for the first time when i was 29.

Due to covid lockdown and homeschooling my kids my running form is at an all time high beating my previous 10k time several times for the last six months.

Im a slow runner, and operate around 7/8min per k on average.

For the last month or so i have had a long run on sundays(10k ish) and a shorter and faster workout on wednesdays(5k, hill intervals etc.)

But recently, maybe the last two weeks, my lungs and heart feel “bruised”. You know when you have a bruise on your leg or arm and you sometimes get a jolt of pain upon pressure. Its the same feeling just that it feels like its “around” the heart and lungs if that makes sense.

I dont feel sick, weak or out of breath in any way. There are just some “jolts” every now and then.

So running, is it possible to bruise your heart and lungs? If so, is it time to stop and until its gone?

Ps. Ive done all the beginner mistakes three times over, have lost 14kg and gone from not being able to run for 12 minutes to finishing a 10k easy in the last 10 years👍🏻😊

I joined OrangeTheory recently partly to prepare for a law enforcement physical fitness test and partly to actually improve stamina since I quickly realize I had barely any.

I’m fine on the rowers and the floor but the treadmill kicks my butt every single time. Even jogging is hard for me so I have to keep my base pace at around 3 and my push is always 6.5 (I can hold that for about 3 minutes), all out i usually set at 9 or 10. 

In order to pass the running portion of the test I have to run 1.5 miles (2.77km) in less than 14 minutes.

I finished that marathon in 3:35, and the next day I got into the pool to teach myself how to swim and got my old road bike out the garage because I had always wanted to complete an Ironman.

I trained from March to November and completed Ironman Cozumel in November 2019 (13:49, total). Paced the Marathon leg horribly and bonked at mile 18 of the run, but finished, which was my only goal (actually, it was my first and maybe last triathlon). After that, I decided to give MAF training a shot and, after resting for a week, I started MAF training (Max HR allowed = 156 bpm at the time). I followed a monotonous plan for 12 weeks, only adding 3 short, key workouts at 3 hr marathon pace (4:16 min/km) at the 8th, 9th, and 10th week of training. Rest of the km were at MAF training heart rate (would average about 4:40 min/km 7:30 min/mile) on typical 50 min runs under 156 bpm). I peaked at 93 km (57 miles) 2 weeks before the race, but that was definitely much higher than my typical weeks (70 km / 43 MPW). I finished my second marathon in 3:00:00 flat, with a negative split (first half in 1:32, second in 1:28). Definitely went too conservative. Had a lot in the tank, and my last km was actually the fastest (3:45 min/km / 6:02 mile pace). After that, I took some time off serious training, only going out for jogs and cross training with my road bike for about 3 months or so.

I have only recently started running again. This is my 7th week of training. I have been running 100-108 km (62 MPW) for 4 consecutive weeks now, with 1-2 quality runs (fartlek and tempo runs), a long run and the other days are mostly easy pace runs (140-145 bpm runs), averaging about 4:49 min/km (7:45 min/mile) at 145 HR cap. I would like your input to see if running under 2:50 in the same course I ran my last two marathons is feasible, with the caveat that I will be running a considerably higher mileage and much more quality workouts (fartleks, tempo runs, VO2 max kind of workouts). I would also like to know if any of you guys would recommend me a good training plan for this goal.

2311,2311,2311,77,Getting REALLY frustrated with my body.,1600124845,"Hi guys so I'm new to running, a bit of background I'm 33M and the last time I properly ran for running sake was in school doing cross country PE which I hated. Growing up I played a lot of rugby as a forward and I've also dabbled in American Football as an offensive guard  I'm 265lb now and in 2019 I was 315lb. 

I used to smoke and basically treated myself like shit. However I've managed to grow up and sort that out and now I can run and my lungs feel great, no super hard breathing like I used to after a short period of exercise etc but my issue now is my legs. 

I'm aware I'm carrying the extra weight and being so overweight for most of my life has damaged my knees and joints. The issue here is my legs start to groan very quickly when I start a run, I'm not doing anything major, just the Couch to 5K. I'm currently on week 4 and doing intervals of 3-5mins of running and 1-2 mins of walking, this lasts around 30 mins. So its not a huge amount in comparison to 'propper' runners but it's just so demotivating when my legs start to complain. My knees and ankles ache but what's the worst is the sides of my feet and ball of foot feel like their burning, and my shins feel pretty crap too during the run. 

I'm running 3 times a week and stretching a lot before I run, I also do a brisk walk for 5 mins before and after I run. 

This week I went and got some proper running shoes and had my running analysis completed it shows I needed more support and I land on my heel, it also shows my ankles top inwards a little. I ended up getting the Saucony Omni 18s and a pair of light cusion running socks. 

Is there anything else you would recommend to help my legs? I'm trying to take 1-2 days rest between runs. I know it should get better as I loose weight but I wonder how much better or what the benefits of just regular running in terms of getting used to running will be Vs the weight loss?

Hope this is ok to post here.

What kind of impact should I expect from this against my first marathon experience?

I went out for a run today around my university campus and on my run I notice an older guy, around 40s, walking in the sidewalk in a fairly open road between campuses (1km stretch, occasional cars and very few people on foot). Because I was running, I did not have my mask on, and because the guy was walking on the sidewalk, I made sure to cross the road 20 meters before reaching him and crossed back again 20 meters after I passed him (I do this for every person I see on the road). He drew my attention and told me to put my mask on. I tried to explain to him in broken local language (I'm a foreing student here) that I was exercising (as if that wasn't obvious) with a meaning that wearing a mask would make it difficult for me to breathe because of the sweat and extra heat. He says that he was exercising too (walking) but he had his mask on regardless because the university wants us to have a mask on everywhere. He told me that because I was running, I was breathing harder and spewing more particles, which I admit IS logical. Anyway, I put my mask on partly because I don't know the language enough to argue with a guy, partly because I did not expect to argue with a guy in the middle of the run (also after I put it on I saw it as a challenge!).

My question is can we expect people who are exercising outside to put on masks and I was the asshole who did not abide to the rule of having a mask on campus, or was he wrong for requiring me to wear a mask even though I made sure to avoid going near him by crossing the road and assuming my filthy breath would dissipate because of the wind? Because I was able to run with the mask on (I was only off by a minute on my 5k time, off by four minutes on my 10k time), now I'm wondering if I should wear a mask all the time.

I started running end of April, while really needing an excuse to get out of the house and get some fresh air. I followed the c25k program and slowly, but surely I finished a 5k in two months.

In July and half of August I continued, enjoying my disconnect from the world while I listen to my songs and run in a way that most people would wonder if I'm either walking or running. Yes, I am that slow.

Anyway, I managed to get a to a 10k when, lo and behold, my life turned upside down. I was feeling exhausted, irritated, sad, would be dizzy and off balance. To put it short, I am deficient in Iron and B12. This is why I had to take this time off running.

(I also didn't really lose any weight while running. This is not the main reason why I started running, but still I expected a bit of loss. Maybe I gained some muscle. But the deficiencies explain it, I guess?) 

I can't understand how one day I ran a 10k and literally a few days later, I felt as bad as I don't wish on anyone.

Considering this one month break, I really want to start running again. I just don't know where to start. Do I start over? Do I go for a 3k the first day? Please give me some advice.

In a week or two I will be running a virtual Berlin Marathon. I have been training as if the event were still taking place, so this will be a great gauge of progress as I slowly make my way towards a BQ.

My problem is that I will miss the literal support that the aid stations of organized races provide.  While I can carry fluids/fuel, my current belt only holds 20 ounces and (I know I sound like a crazy person) I don’t want to carry any extra weight if I am running for a PR.

My fiancée has generously offered to man an aid station (and sacrifice three hours of her weekend free time) so I am left with the question of how to plan this.  

I couldn’t trick her into cycling alongside of me like Kipchoge so it will have to be some sort of circuit. Am I a crazy person to consider running it on a 400 meter track?  I get the upsides of micromanaging my pace with frequent laps and it likely provides the easiest means of handing off fluids (gran a water bottle from her and chuck it back on the infield), but I get the downsides of the insane boredom of 105+ laps and maybe the pain of all those corners.

I am going to be a hosting a weeklong virtual running event for a university’s local alumni club that I am a part of.

So I’m asking for any suggestions in making a really fun event! So far I’m thinking of scoring a leaderboard in terms of total miles run over one week (rather than a traditional fastest time over 5k wins) and charging a flat entry fee of $25 ish. 

Has anyone been a part of or organized any successful virtual runs? What made them fun? What helped raise more money? How did you engage people to participate?

2386,2386,2386,53,Ran my first sub 1 hour 10k yesterday!,1600090658,"A little background. 

In High School I was a state 4x400 runner and also ran the 100 and 200. Shortly after High School I ran a 20:21 5k and a Tough Mudder. 

Of course life changes and now turning 27 I find myself more sedentary than ever being a videographer and spending a lot of my time at a desk editing, so needless to say serious running wasn’t in my cards for awhile.

Rewind to 2018 and my father (a Tough Mudder Ambassador to this day) was diagnosed with cancer (currently cancer free and still running Tough Mudders) and while he was going through chemo I ran another Tough Mudder in his place, with no preparation mind you. 

The hardest run I have ever ran.

So now as we hit another month of quarantine I decided to make a change. Worlds Toughest Mudder is being held virtually and my dad and I are going to compete. I have ~2 months to prepare and since I ran that 20:21 5k my goal has been to get a sub 20 minute run. Since my strength and cardio are not what they were during my high school days a 30 minute 5k is more my average on a good day.

The way Worlds Toughest Mudder works is to do 5 mile laps and then a fitness challenge (we do not know what the challenges are yet) so I chose to sideline my 5k running to do 5 mile running instead (I figured the added miles would in turn help my cardio for the 5k down the road anyway).

Somehow the stars aligned yesterday and I was able to run (with the intent of a sub one hour 5 mile) a 28:04 5k by accident feeling amazing, then a 48:14 5 mile still feeling great, my pacing was consistent so why not try for the 10k? Boom 58:57. 

I have gone from maybe on a good month 5-10 miles of running to 30-50 miles and I have no doubt that when summer 2021 rolls around I’ll be hitting that sub 20 5k.

I was averaging a pace of 8:09 per mile (11 miles) and 8:12 per mile (12 miles) during my long runs during training so I was expecting the same if not a little bit better. 

I can only think I did better then expected because the course was mostly flat, weather starting was 58 degrees and cloudy (aka beautiful running weather) and actually have people to run after/towards.

I also know there are 100 threads about runners’ knee. I’ve sifted through them and still feel unsure.

After a 20k yesterday, my right knee is in agony, especially when I bend it. It’s too painful to cycle, go up the stairs, or even walk for too long. I RICEd it most of yesterday.

I am really unsure of what actions to take. I live in the UK and am confused about whether or not I can contact my GP in the current climate, whether I should for a minor injury, or whether I would get a physio referral any time this century anyway.

I am a student so paying for a private physio is something I could do at a stretch but only if I can be sure it’s the best course of action.

Same re: advice like buy new trainers - I literally spent more money than I can afford on some new running shoes not long ago.

I find advice about strength training etc overwhelming and at times contradictory. I don’t have a huge amount of time in the day to experiment with things which might not work or make it better. I’m also dyspraxic so while I love running, anything that involves fine motor skills takes more work for me than other people.

I have a very low BMI, and I would say I have been training less, rather than more, recently. I built up to half marathon on a training plan over 3 months and never exceed my previous weekly mileage by more than 2km.

Full disclosure, I’ve never really warmed up, warmed down (except walking last km) or stretched. I don’t know how to and honestly am skeptical about how effective stretching is. Probably foolishly!

I am training for my first marathon in April, and this setback is stressing me out loads. Like many, running has been my lifeline and I know my mental heath will suffer if I can’t.

2421,2421,2421,90,Ran my first 10k and my first under 20 5K.After 3 years with some help from this group,1600053283,"Back in 2017, I had severe depression and was unable to cope up with anything. I don't remember how I started running but I progressed a lot over the last 3 years. Coming from being unable to run a single mile, to running 6 of those without stopping. Since last 2 years I have always wanted to run longer distances and shorter distances in lower times. Since the start of 2020 I have been running daily(almost) for last 9 months. I got to my first 4mile,5mile and finally to my first 6mile. Pre-Lockdown (About March)  I was able to run a sub 21(20:19) 5k on a treadmill with 1-2% elevation. But since my gym closed down I was forced to run outside on concrete road which hurt my legs initially. After practising 2 months, I was able to go back to finishing a 5K in about June.  After that I used go down daily and just try to outrun my last timing. It was a bad bad idea, I was lucky to not get injured as I was told but I was somehow able to break the sub 20 barrier at 19:45 5k. I shifted my focus onto 10k after that but about a month ago, I had this problem :  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ia3pe4/how\_to\_mentally\_fight\_the\_discomfort\_while/](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/ia3pe4/how_to_mentally_fight_the_discomfort_while/)

and some very helpful tips from random strangers u/nnnude, u/[luckyj714](https://www.reddit.com/user/luckyj714/) and u/[Haku\_Champloo](https://www.reddit.com/user/Haku_Champloo/), massively helped the process. This was a turning point and I realized in my bid to run a sub 20 mins 5k I was forgetting to build my endurance for longer runs. So I started running longer distances and slowly. I reached a 4mile after almost 5 months at 7:45 a mile ( from my average of being between 6:30-7:30 a mile) . I was able to finish a 10k running at 8 min a mile (7:53 to be precise) but I had to stop in between. But as I was slowly building the endurance after 4 weeks of failure to cover the distance, I decided to change my strategy. Rather than preparing myself mentally to think about the distance left, while running, I prompted myself to think about the end goal that is the 10k mark. That shifted my focus from constantly looking at the phone for the distance to practically not think about running. The motion came naturally to me. I was just running and nothing else. The outcome was a 7:02 a mile 10k finishing in 43:39. The very fact that I was able to complete the run was staggering. The fact I of all people was able to do something I considered difficult was staggering. I had never even imagined myself being able to run above 4 or even 5 mile, let alone the entire 6.22. This run gave me something I didn't have with me for so long: Self Respect.  

Even in the toughest of periods, when I did not have any hope, I had running. I have lost 17Kgs since 2017 and become lean. This year amongst others have been the hardest for a lot of us. Especially bad for many of us. People losing everyday, but at the end of the day when you complete a run with the distance you had in mind (or more) you won the day, and that means you have the ability to fight the next one. If someone like me who has been cheated on, been called incompetent  several times, decimated mentally because of my job  and just not have any prospects whatsoever has the ability to endure a 44 minute run at 7 minute a mile (almost 14kmph) , then I (and especially anyone else reading this) definitely has the ability to kick 2020 in the nuts and just walk away while it's on the ground. The fact that you are able to run any distance at any speed whatsoever is a proof of the fact that you can do anything. And if I have a shred of doubt I cannot do something I will be focusing will be annihilating that completing my first half marathon and my first sub 18 5k.

It is my therapy, even though yes, I am in therapy. But it's running that keeps me in check. Since October last year my issues havent been consistent. It comes and goes. I can't really figure an exact trigger but I feel my 2018 race was what set everything in motion. I always wondered if it's because my body is thrown outta whack and everything is trying regulate normally again post race. Well I ran my 6th marathon last week and today I feel all these depressive tendencies creeping back in. I am just overwhelmed with sadness and feelings of worthlessness. I can't help but truly feel it's related to something in the effects of the marathon on the body. Running brings me some of the greatest joys I've ever known in my life. Choosing to run/race is one of my life's greatest decisions. And even though it seems to bring about depressive tendencies at times it's also saved my life. Running has saved me from myself.

* **Date:** September 12, 2020
* **Distance:** 50 kilometers
* **Location:** Kent, UK

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Finish in one piece | *Yes* |
| B | Sub 4:30 | *No* |

### Training
I've only been running seriously since December, although I ran track and XC when I was younger so it didn't take me long to establish a base.

I signed up for this race about seven weeks ago. I was running 35-40 mpw at the time. I gradually increased my mileage and peaked around 60 three weeks ago. The main thing I did differently was increase my long runs by a lot. I bumped them up from 2 hours to 3+ hours, and most weekends I would do back-to-back long runs (although the second long run was rarely more than 2 hours). My last few back-to-backs totaled more than 50k, and my final back-to-back session totaled just under 40 miles. After that, I tapered well and I felt fresh by race day.

However, I made the mistake that a lot of trail noobs make. I didn't spend nearly enough time training on the type of terrain that I would race on.

### Pre-race
The race was held in a beautiful area in the English countryside, and the weather was perfect. Being in a big field in the middle of the woods, it was very easy to follow social distancing rules. They also had us line up in separate groups based on estimated finish times, and they staggered the starts one-by-one, with several seconds between each person and 10 minutes in between each big group.

### Race
I went out with the lead group. I started the race feeling very overconfident. But luckily it didn't take me long to realize that I was going out too fast, so after the first couple of miles I let the group get away from me and settled into my own pace. I ran more or less on my own for the first 18-20k. I passed through the first aid station feeling great. At one point I made a wrong turn, but something felt off so I took out my phone and checked the GPX file of the course and found my way back.

A group of runners caught up to me somewhere around 18-20k and we ran together for a while. I was still feeling great, but the bumps and hills and rugged terrain were starting to get to me. I wasn't tired but my quads began feeling heavy, which never happened in training. Around 25k, we got to a series of very steep hills. All of us walked up them rather than try to tough it out and tire out our legs. But we ran down all the steep downhill sections, and those likely burned out my quads just as much.

This group of runners got away from me at the second aid station. After refueling there, I ran on my own for a little while and soon caught up to a few people from the group who had fallen back. Around this point I noticed the weather getting hotter. I stayed with them for a few miles, but when we were running through a flat section through some wide open farmland, the heat started getting to me so I slowed down and let them go. At this point, I started feeling the dreaded ""bonk"" creeping up on me. I started hydrating and eating more frequently, trying to stave off the inevitable bonk for as long as I could.

Eventually I jogged in to the third and final aid station. At this point I was feeling destroyed. I was really unwell. I sat down in a chair and genuinely thought I was done. My body did not want to move any more. I stayed at that aid station for probably 10 minutes. I drank some coke and ate some salty chips (sorry, ""crisps""). Eventually I got up and tried to get moving again, but I literally couldn't run for more than a minute or so. My body just wouldn't do it. I had bonked spectacularly.

There were 7 miles between the last aid station and the finish. I walked the first one, maybe two. I was in a bad, bad state. But after a little while, my state improved a bit. I still felt terrible, but I was able to start jogging at a slow pace again. I passed through a town with about 4 miles to go, and actually started feeling good enough to run at a pace that felt somewhat normal. I'm not sure if this qualifies as ""coming back"" from a bonk, because I still felt like death, but I did come back from the bonk in the sense that I was able to settle back into some semblance of a run.

I still had to stop and walk a few times in those last few miles any time there was a hill. But for the most part, I ran it in. I must have been running way slower than I thought though, just based on how long those last 4 miles took. At this point I was feeling delirious, but when I came across an area that I recognized from the beginning of the race, I knew there was less than a mile left so I just booked it as fast as I could. I finished the race in 6 hours.

### Nutrition/Hydration
I brought my favorite long-run snacks with me, apricots and granola bars. At the aid stations, I would eat either chips (""crisps"") or bananas. I didn't have any stomach issues. I should have eaten a bit more, but I think I did okay in terms of taking in calories. Hydration was the bigger issue for me. I felt like I was drinking plenty of water, but something must have been off. I was drinking water mixed with ""Zero"" electrolyte tablets. Zero is really not the best brand; I normally stick with Nuun but I ran out of Nuuns and forgot to buy more.

Aside from the trails killing my leg muscles too early in the race, dehydration was probably the main factor in my bonk. I literally didn't have to pee all day despite drinking plenty. Also, my tongue went numb (?!) in the last few miles of the race. It was a bit scary.

### Post-race
The organizers did an amazing job putting this race together. It was a great event and the whole thing went smoothly.

This was very humbling for me; I knew that trail racing was different but I didn't realize just how different it was. I'm aware that I didn't spend a very long time training for this, so I'm just happy to have completed it and to be able to say that I've done an ultramarathon.

I've got a marathon coming up in November on a 100% flat, level course. After that I plan to focus on speed and improving my 5k/10k times. So it will probably be quite a while before I do another trail ultra, and I doubt I'd ever do more than two or three of these a year. But, having said that, I will definitely be back for more. This race was as fun as it was painful, and it's made an ultramarathon fan out of me.

I just came home from a fun celebratory run even though today was a rest day. I've been a runner for a year exactly now and I just had a fun run where I couldn't stop smiling. I think I blushed thinking about how much I enjoy doing it.

I wanted to share this with you all because it's the first time where everything was lined up. The music, weather, my kickass gear (nothing heavy, just normal stuff, but I looked quite nice tonight), mood. Yesterday I did a long run of 29kms and was fairly satisfied with it. Today was supposed to be a rest day but I felt no post-run DOMS or irregularities, so it was a fresh Sunday already.

Quite certain all the people who saw me running while blushing were quite confused to see me smile so wide while running. It was like realizing you are in love with the girl you've been dating for months.  Like this time you made love instead of having sex. I think this clarity also makes sense since I always realize late that I'm in love with a partner. So after a year of running, tonight being tonight makes a lot of sense. I've never dreaded running. I'm fairly passionate about it and have completed my share of an FM, and loads of HMs. Never thought an activity could make me feel the same way I feel when falling in love with an individual.

I saw people in cars look at me and smile back including a 5-6 y/o kid!! and ofc one of those asshole drivers who try to tick runners off by passing by really close just to get a reaction out of us. That didn't bother me much because It was trivial for today.

Hi guys,

I run about 40k/week and recently started weight lifting twice a week as I'd like to improve my muscle mass. I dont want to be super bulky, but would like some definition.

However, I'm confused about calorie intake and nutrition. I understand that I need a low carb/high protein diet to gain muscles, but at the same time I also need carbs to fuel my runs? Also, what would my calorie intake be like? Should I just eat intuitively? I usually fast in the mornings and eat between 1500 to 2000 calories a day. Does that seem enough? I also heard I need to eat more...

Need your input guys!

######**Why should I run in the winter?**

* Winter running makes you strong!

* That person you really want to beat next year is out there training right now

* Spring weather feels so much better when you’ve been training through the winter

* [Some goats somewhere got fast just be being cold]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11124132). Maybe it will work for you, too

######**Clothing**

You’re going to want materials that will keep you warm even when damp or wet. Think wool, fleece, and wicking synthetics. You’ll also want things to be breathable so you don’t get super sweaty (and even colder).  Layer up so you can adjust during your run.

Trapped air is what keeps you warm and cozy in the winter. If you’re shoes are really tight with a couple pairs of socks on, or your gloves/mittens are too tight, you may have less trapped air and impair circulation, which will make you cold.

Here’s an example of what works well for me in calm, dry conditions. Keep in mind wind or precipitation will make things colder, and that it’s always better to have an extra layer than to make do without.

**Temp Range**|**Upper**|**Lower**|**Socks**|**Hands**|**Head**
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
30 to 40F (-1 to 5C)|It’s|Not|Even|Winter|Yet (/r/gatekeeping)
20 to 30F (-6 to -1C)|LS Baselayer|Regular tights|1x midweight wool|Light gloves|headband
10 to 20F (-12 to -6C)|LS Baselayer + wind vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs|2x midweight wool|Mittens|Hat + light gator
0 to 10F (-18 to -12C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket or vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens|heavy hat, fleece balaclava, eye protection
&lt;0 F (&lt;-18 C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens w/ gloves underneath|heavy hat x2, fleece balaclava, eye protection (glasses or goggles, if windy)

######**Footwear**

Road shoes are fine most of the time, unless you're running somewhere that consistently has snow or ice-covered sidewalks. If you have good socks, your feet should stay warm even if damp from melting snow. Think more carefully about your footwear if there’s snow or ice on the ground.
On fresh snow or packed, but still soft snow, trail shoes (something with a low to moderate lug) work very well.  [Turning an old pair of road shoes into Screw Shoes](https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-shoe-screws) is an excellent idea for ice, thawed and refrozen snow, and heavily packed snow conditions – the screws do a great job providing a bit of extra traction.

You can also look into traction devices (like Yaktrax) when icy.

When running, direction changes and stopping are the most likely times to slip and fall on snow or ice. Slow down and be cautious around corners and street crossings. As you run, make sure you’re landing with your feet underneath your center of mass – even if you do have a slippery step, keep your feet moving, and you can usually recover and avoid a fall.

######**Safety**

If you work during the day, chances are your morning or evening run will be dark. Get yourself a good headlamp (to see and be seen), and wear a reflective vest over your other clothing. Know that motorists may be less likely to expect you to be out running when it’s 15 degrees and snowing.

If it's really cold, make adjustments or plans to ensure you can stay safe during your run even if you turn an ankle or something else happens where you can't keep running to stay warm. Plan your route along safe warm zones (friend's house, grocery stores, etc.), and/or carry your cell phone (close to your body, so your battery doesn't die). If you for some reason can't run, you will quickly get very chilled.

Start your runs into the wind - this will be the coldest part - so that your finish your runs with a warmer tailwind. This can make a big difference - if you get sweaty during your run, and turn into a stiff breeze to finish, you're likely to get chilled as you're heading home.

######**Nutrition**

Even when it’s cold out, you’ll want to be sure you’re hydrated before and during long runs. You’re probably sweating more than you might think, it will evaporate quickly in cold dry air. Have a method to keep fluids from freezing when it’s cold out, either by keeping fluids under a layer of clothing (vest or hydration pack), planning a route around accessible water, or figuring out a way to keep your handheld from freezing up.

Gels and other foods can freeze too – tuck these items into a glove or mitten a few minutes before you want to eat, to thaw them out and warm them up.

2524,2524,2524,95,Some of my thoughts on the news about Caster Semenya,1599998076,"I was really saddened to hear about the recent rulings regarding Caster Semenya's ability to compete. It got me thinking more about the issue, and I wanted to share my thoughts with other runners. Feel free to start a discussion! Here are my thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. About 1.7% of the world population is intersex. ([Source](https://www.intersexequality.com/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/))
2. A whole lot of people in the world are runners!
3. Certainly, there are plenty of runners out there who are also intersex.
4. Compared to the number of intersex runners who are NOT elite runners, there are very few intersex runners who ARE elite runners.
5. Accordingly, compared to the number of non-intersex runners who are not elite runners, there are very few non-intersex runners who are elite runners.
6. So, Semenya didn't become an elite runner BECAUSE she is intersex. If that were true, we would expect to see a lot more intersex runners at the elite level--which we don't. She became one because of the hard work, the constant practice and training, that she put into the sport.
7. Furthermore, given that there are undoubtedly many, many other runners who are intersex, and given that only this big of a fuss has been made about Semenya--an elite runner--the issue cannot simply be that Semenya is intersex. The issue is that she is FAST and that she WINS. People can't handle the fact that an intersex person is threatening the superiority of the non-intersex people in the sport.

Three years ago I ran during a period where we had a lot of smoky days. I was laid up for 7+ weeks in the middle of marathon training.

Those 7-8 weeks were pure torture.  Very little sleep, deep, persistent cough (diagnosed as bronchitis), fever, and a diagnosed sinus infection. I couldn’t run anywhere within 90-120secs of my typical easy pace, and any sort of interval was out of the question.

There legitimately were times I considered if I’d need to go to the hospital because I felt I was in another world and would wake up coughing so much I was sure I had some permanent lung damage.

The doc who diagnosed me was extremely confident that it all stemmed from the days I ran in hazardous air, and strongly advised me to check AQI every time I run.

Don’t be like me.  Don’t throw away 8 weeks and all your built up fitness just to be a hero and run when no one else will.  This isn’t running in winter below zero.  If your lungs are damaged, it will take a while before you ever regain full fitness.  I’m still not quite where I was back then.

Since recovering from the coronavirus, I ran my first 10 mile run ever. For some context, prior to covid, my longest run was 8.5 miles and I was running at the most 20 miles per week. I didn't even set out to run 10 miles today, but the weather was about 15 degrees cooler than it's been, and it was the most perfect day. I was training for the Broad Street Run in Philadelphia, which got canceled and went virtual due to Covid. When I tested positive for Covid in April, I was devastated and I had to sit out running for 3 months. But in July, I started running again. First, just very short runs, with lots of rest in between. Then little by little, I did my first 5k since recovering, then a 10k, then a 7.5 miler. For whatever reason, today, the run just felt easy. The wind was perfect and I decided to do an awesome running route, and then it just turned into 10 miles!

My time was 2:05 which I realize is incredibly slow for majority of runners on this subreddit, but I am so proud of my time considering everything I dealt with this year - and I wanted to share my accomplishment!

2589,2589,2589,62,What to do if you have shin splints. (Advice from a Physical Therapist),1599943730,"Hey all, I hope I can help those dealing with shin splints at the moment.   


I've seen so many people posting to this subreddit and other running-based subreddits hoping for some help with their shin splints, and thought I might try and help where I can. I'm an Austrlian Physical Therapist who's a little different to most. I'm really passionate about trying to uncover and solve the root cause of common aches, pains, and injuries and I've come to understand a lot about shin splints over the last 15 years. Please take this advice with a grain of salt and definitely see a PT for a more specific take on your shin splints, but keep the following in mind:

From what I see clinically, we need to stop thinking of shin splints as a shin problem - as silly as that probably sounds. Instead, we need to think of those shins as the area of the leg that no longer tolerates how the broader leg is functioning. More specifically, things like ankle joint stiffness, hip joint stiffness, hip flexor tightness, hip rotator tightness, hip rotator weakness/poor control and even low back dysfunction change the way the entire leg functions. And when this subpar function is exposed to something repetitive like running, something within that system may fail eventually. And unfortunately for many, that area can be the shins.

I think this is a really important distinction to make because without that broader perspective many can be left putting all their time and energy into highly specific things without addressing the underlying reason for it being their in the first place - which as many unfortunately know, is a recipe for serious frustration. Common approaches like changing footwear, looking for more arch support, adding a heel to shoes, going barefoot or minimalist, changing stride length, avoiding running on concrete/hard surfaces, going for shorter runs, icing, resting from running completely, shin scraping, calf stretching, taping, injections, local massage, and even giving up completely may all have an impact on your shin pain in some way, but, by definition, may only be temporary (if it helps at all).

I'm certainly an advocate for some of the above, but by addressing the broader leg dysfunction I find many of them become redundant. Mainly because we are restoring normal function to the entire leg. We're trying to put out the ongoing cause of the fire, not just trying to consistently douse it. Yes, you may need to tone down the km's if your shins are screaming, but it's ultimately fruitless if you don't change those mechanics before ramping things back up again. Arch support may help, but those arches will still want to collapse regardless if your hips and ankles force it to happen. Changing your stride length may decrease the load on those shins (and decrease your pain) but it won't de-stiffen your ankles, or restore normal mobility and strength to you hips- things that not only help resolve the cause of shin splints, but conspire to make you a better athlete/runner.

Also, if you have shin splints and get around all day in a pair of heeled shoes or flip flops/thongs, please strongly consider a change in shoes as they are a haven for ankle and shin dysfunction. Any heel is the exact amount of ankle range you don't get access too while you're wearing them and is one of the major contributors to the ankle stiffness associated with so much lower leg dysfunction. Similarly, flip flops/thongs are absolutely one of the worst things you can attach to any foot that is attached to someone who values being athletic.

Ultimately, I just wanted to pop in and say that I'm sorry so many people are effected by shin splints, and by all means please keep looking for those more local, symptomatic options, as you have to do anything and everything you can to allow yourselves to keep running. But I hope that by shedding a little more light on these broader issues, it gives anyone affected some more direction and hopefully find those final missing pieces of the puzzle.

2590,2590,2590,63,Ran my second half marathon ever (and second in the last 30 days) and improved by 9 min! Req for feedback and advice!,1599942979,"I'm a COVID runner who decided to try for a half marathon. I shied  away from running for years because my feet would go completely numb at about the five km mark. I have literally tried everything and while I have minimized it, it still happens every run. Doctors say short of spinal surgery that's just how she be. I run until my feet go numb and then walk until the feeling comes back. Defying all physiological sense, the numbness has never returned for a second time during any of my runs. Has anyone experienced this? 

 With gyms closed I took up running and signed up for the virtual Seawheeze Half Marathon hosted by Lululemon.  I ran and finished it in late August. It did not go well. I bought nune tabs with caffeine (without realizing) and popped one into my bottle of water for the run. Sucked back some gels and blocs periodically but by about km 13 things were going sideway. Evidently those too had caffeine. My heart rate was around 190 but peaked as high as 206 (32, m) and I was bonking haaarrddd. I had to walk quite a bit to keep the heart rate down and had dizzy spells.  Stupidly, I decided to finish when I probably should have stopped but I powered through with a  time of 2:22 - 5 min slower than I expected. 

Flash forward to today and I dropped nune all together and used coconut water. Still used bloks but took one every 5 k and felt fine. I got a 2:13! So excited to continue to improve and take a stab at a full marathon next year.

### Race Description
Blame  /u/rickard0 for this one too.  They asked for more race reports so now I have to just make up races.  Hope you’re happy  /u/rickard0.  Also blame Google for this one.  I confess that I do occasionally watch a WWE clip on Youtube which probably is what prompted them to give me an ad for an action figure that is Macho Man Randy Savage done in 80s Masters of the Universe style.  I am a child of the 80s so this obviously appealed to me.  I found that the local Walmart actually had it in stock for pickup and this Friday was payday.  But that Walmart is also about 5 miles away and my long run on my completely unnecessary marathon plan has me doing 13 miles.  What to do with this problem? I could drive to Walmart to pick up the Macho Man like a normal person but why be normal?  Macho certainly wasn’t. 

### Training
You know who actually trains for things?  Boring people. I have it on good authority that the Macho Man never trained.  He was simply born great and coasted his entire life.  This is the philosophy I totally want to embrace except I was not born great.  My longest run this year (aside from my half on Jan 1 where I got injured) has been about 9 miles.  I spent the summer running nearly 30-40 mpw every week but the heat was insane (95-100F+) so my “long run” was about 10k most weeks going up to maybe 8 miles if it was cooler.  Due to the heat, most of those miles were at a very, very slow pace.  I was supposed to run 10 miles last week but the dog was sick so I ran 0 miles.  Been tapering for the past two weeks as I wanted fresh legs for marathon training and I guess I’d find out if this worked.  

### Pre-race
The weather was going to work out for me it seemed.  The high was only 83 and I started just after getting my lazy ass out of bed so it was cooler than that.  I chowed down on half a dozen gummy lifesavers as is my tradition and got my gear ready to go.  I put on my new-ish Salomon Adv Skin 12.  I’ve had this for a couple of months but only used it once because it’s black and it blocks my entire back and causes back sweat.  This wouldn’t be a huge issue in the cooler temps and the ability to carry a 2l bladder and have an extra pocket for Macho to ride in seemed worth it.  I planned to use it extensively for my now cancelled marathon so not sure when I’m going to use it now. Having not really done a long run all year I don’t really have a good nutrition/fueling system worked out.  The only fuel I had on hand was some Sport Beans so I shoved them into a vest pocket just in case I needed them.  I didn’t figure it mattered here as Walmart was only 5 miles away and if I couldn’t find fuel there I was doing something wrong.  I strapped on the Brooks and hit the road.

### Race
The road to the Walmart has sidewalks pretty much the entire way except for a quarter mile segment.  There are many, many, many street crossings (one about every 1/8th of a mile for a good portion of the route and there’s about a mile of the road that slopes entirely uphill.  It’s not a big hill or a steep one but it’s long and I hate any sort of hills at all.  I put on a podcast and started off slowly.  I know this is technically a “race report” but I took this at more of a long run pace and was happy-ish with the time I was making.  My half marathon PR is around 3 hrs (got injured) so I was confident I could break that at least.  The first mile was rough coming in around 15:37 as I spent way too much time adjusting things on the vest and trying to get it to sit comfortably.  I’ve used it only once before so there were still adjustments needed to get it to sit right.    

I confess that once I got to Walmart I paused the watch.  I know that pausing your watch during a run is bad form but I’m reasonably certain that Macho took a steel chair to some guys once or twice.  If he can heel it up, so can I.  

Since covid I’ve been avoiding stores other than a once a month grocery buy but this Walmart has pickup at the very front of the store so I can get in and out without interacting with anyone.  I picked up the Macho King and bought [a candy bar for fuel and a Slim Jim](https://i.imgur.com/Y8eNL2Q.jpg) to honor the Great One.  Both were purchased within 10-20 ft of the front door.   I ate the candy but the Slim Jim was way too large to eat before leaving the store.  I realized I needed some other things like milk but I didn’t want to carry all of it back with me.  Also, what if the milk turned into a milkshake on the hour or so trip back and what if that milkshake brought all the boys to the yard? The last thing I wanted was to get in trouble for having a party in the middle of covid.  I stuck with just the Macho Man for the trip back putting him in the back pocket of my vest so he could ride in the style he deserves all the way home.

The run back felt much, much slower than the run there.  I could feel myself tiring and bonked around mile 9.  I could not find the Sport Beans in my vest at all which annoyed me.  Once I got back to the house I was at around 10 miles.  There’s a loop in the neighborhood that is ~3 miles.  I admit I was flagging hard at this point.  I dropped off the vest at the house, grabbed my handheld and some gummy lifesavers and went out for the last three miles.  I might’ve shouted “Ohhhh Yeah!!” every mile or so and some of my neighbors now think I’m crazy.   The last mile was a gigantic struggle and my stomach was telling me that I desperately needed to get to the bathroom.  I fully intended to run 13.1 today but if I did that I would be doing an extensive cleanup of myself afterwards.  The last part of the 13.06 was a sprint to the bathroom running through the house without even bothering to take my shoes off.  

### Post-race
I finished with a time of 2:56:28 which is sort of a new PR for me.  My PR for 13.1 is 2:59 and I would definitely have covered .03 miles in less than 2.5 mins but I didn’t actually do that in reality.  Overall I was disappointed at my performance honestly.  I had no idea I had lost **THIS** much fitness this summer.  I ran this same distance in Jan when I was injured and 15lbs heavier and now I only carved 2.5 mins or so off my time despite being lighter and having fresh legs.  Not a great performance at all. I was impressed by the Salomon though.  Once I got it situated, I hardly knew I was wearing it and the 1.8l in the back was very helpful.  It easily held the giant Slim Jim, my wallet and the Macho Man himself. 

I  did treat Macho as a trophy for this race and [hung him in an appropriate place](https://imgur.com/QgAmWI2.jpg) and had the Slim Jim for a post race snack.  Garmin now recommends 3.5 days for recovery from this one run.  I admit I do feel like utter trash.  Quads and calves are throbbing and my head is spinning.  Definitely going to feel this one tomorrow but tomorrow is a rest day anyway and Monday only has 3 miles so should be easy enough.

Today I swam a few miles in the ocean before my 8 mile run, and noticed my HR was a little higher on the run. At the end my watch said I’d burned about 750 calories, so ~150 more than normal.

This is my (F21) first time posting in this group. I started running at the age of 12 and would stick to 1-3 mile distances, always very average times and endurance. In high school, I ran XC and track but never got under 28min 5k and felt like I physically could not get faster or run longer distances. At meets, the fast girls would literally say things like ""you just have fun out there"", restating the fact that I was not a ""serious"" runner. 

In college I lifted more weights and definitely got faster and built up my endurance, easily running 5-7 miles at 8 to 8:30/mile. My mental health spiraled and I stopped running and consistently exercising. I'm decently fit, definitely underweight (5'7, 112 lbs), but I just still run pretty slow and can't imagine getting to a place where I can run 5-10 miles. Right now, it takes me 9:30/mile and I haven't run more than 2 this entire year.

2618,2618,2618,91,"Thanks to slowing down and getting on a training plan, this morning I PR'd my half by 19 minutes (and accidentally PR'd my 10k and 5k too)",1599927503,"One of my main fitness goals for 2020 was to run a Half Marathon in under 2 hours. I only started running last summer and was very ignorant on how to train. Naively, I though I needed to train at my goal pace. Starting in January, I tried to run every run at my half goal pace (~9:05/mile), gradually increasing the distance. 

In May, I thought I was ready. (I was not). I ran a half marathon every Sunday (5 times). Every Sunday I tried to beat 2 hours. Predictably, I crashed hard every time, usually between miles 5 and 8. I only managed to not stop and walk on one of those runs. My fastest time was 2:12:25. My slowest was 2:38:xx. 

About that time, I was getting more active on this sub and started to hear about the concept of ""easy"" runs and training plans. So I decided to get serious and find a training plan. 

 HUGE shoutout to /u/free_running_plans !! I found his Half Marathon training plans and decided to follow the 12-week intermediate (since my weekly mileage at the time was on par). I read in his plan that the majority of my runs would be at a 2-2:30 min/mile pace slower than my current 5k pace. I was VERY skeptical that I could improve my fitness running so slow. But I decided to trust the plan and do exactly what it says. I figured I'd give it a chance and in 12 weeks I would be able to see the results for myself, good or bad. 

The first few weeks on the plan were hard. I felt like I was regressing. I doubted that it would pay off. But again, I decided to give it an honest chance. I did enjoy the speed workouts, strides, and hill sprints. That was all new to me and a nice change of pace. 

I followed every workout to a T. I didn't miss a workout or a target pace. I never stopped to walk (except on interval workouts, of course:). I did everything as prescribed. As the weeks ticked, both my fitness and my confidence in the plan grew. By the time I got to this morning, I was very confident in my ability to beat 2 hours. 

But it went so much better than I expected. 

I naturally run negative splits and tend to perform better with that than with even splits. So I created a PacePro strategy on my Garmin that started me at a 9:30/mi pace, finishing at 8:30/mi pace, with a target time of 1:58:00. (I wanted a couple minutes of buffer in case). 

I was so comfortable throughout the entirety of the race. Probably too much so for what was supposed to be a race effort. I had to fight to keep my pace at plan for the first 5-6 miles. But I cared more about beating 2 hours than anything, so I wanted to play it conservative. 

At the halfway point, I started to let myself speed up ahead of plan. Then at the 10 mile mark, with 5k to go, I really opened it up. At this point I knew I was golden and comfortable going for it.

I was shocked when I finished the run and up popped ""4 new records"". I was already so happy about hitting my goal, then to see I also PRd my 10k and 5k, I couldn't believe it. When I synced to Strava [it showed 7 new PRs](https://imgur.com/5afOmXU).

In the end, I improved my half by 19 min, my 10k by 3 minutes, and my 5k by 30 seconds.

* Half: 2:12:25  --&gt;  1:53:08

* 10k: 53:13  --&gt;  50:04

* 5k: 24:36 --&gt; 24:01


I had high hopes, but I still underestimated the difference that slowing down and training properly can make. Especially, I suppose, for newer runners like myself. 

I'm so glad I stuck with it through those first few weeks when I felt like I was going in the wrong direction.  Huge thanks, again, to /u/free_running_plans and an assist to mother nature as well for coming through with a 67 degree morning.

**Training/ Background**

29 years old with an no real sport background, but more of an active lifestyle. Like hiking, playing discgolf, going on adventures, skiing etc. Height: 176cm Weight: 74.5kg (was at 81.5 in January).

Started running 1.5 years ago (spring 2019), after I had made an attempt at some more serious cross-country skiing during the winter of 2018/2019. Also I felt I was getting a bit chubbier and wanted to do something about it. However... I tried a bit too much and hard, so ended up injuring myself, diagnosed as IT band syndrome. So that ruined my running during the summer of 2019. Instead I did more strength training during late summer and then the autumn of 2019. Transitioned to using the Ski-erg machine, then cross-country skiing and running on treadmill once the snow came. Built up my endurance and smashed my previous 30k cross-country skiing race time (2:22)

Wanting to make the most of this new-found love for training I started slowly running again once the spring came. And then Covid happened. However, being in Sweden (no full lockdown) for me it really just meant that I had lots of time over for training, since everything else was cancelled. I stopped drinking (as there was no possibility of going out anyway) and focused my effort on running. Signed up to the Polar Flow automated running program, which helped me learn the importance of running slow and running fast. Started borrowing running books from the library, listening to podcasts and just getting sucked into running in general. 

Started increasing my mileage and currently around between 40 -60km running per week, plus some alternative training such as hiking, discgolf, transport cycling and strength training. I could probably improve my training structure as I don't do that many proper workouts and more focusing on slow recovery runs, tempo runs and occasional long rungs.

In February I did my first Sub-60, then in March I did my first Sub-55 10K, Sub-50 in April, sub-48 in early June and towards end of June sub-46 (45:46), which I been stuck at since then.

**Pre race**

Two days ago I did an after work run with a colleague, and our ""slow run"" ended up being 46:20, feeling hard but not that hard once we were done. So wanted to make the most of it, choosing to try a PR attempt this weekend at the same race course.

Slow Saturday morning with quite a big breakfast consisting of porridge and sandwiches. Then relaxed for an hour before I took the subway into my gym to get changed. Was quite nervous but got myself in the right mood by listening to some hard rock music as well as heavy Swedish rap. Got changed and headed out in the rain and wind, doing a 1.5k warm-up run to my start followed by a few strides. 

**Race**

Chosen a very flat race course which would loop around a stream. Needed to do one extra loop over two bridges to be able to end the 10k where I wanted (meaning instead I had no traffic lights to care about). A bit of rain and wind, but the plus side of this was that it was fairly empty where I was intending to race compared to what's usually the case. 

1k felt okay, a bit tired and stiff. Asked myself if this was pushing it given that I ran a 10k in 46:20 two days earlier. At the 2k mark this feeling was gone and I could focus on enjoying the wind and rain in my face, while telling myself I look strong and fast. I read somewhere that smiling makes you a faster runner, so this was my go to during these first km's. Checked the watch every 500m to see that I was on pace, and not pushing too hard or going to slow. Kept going over and under the 4.30 min per km pace during the first 5k. Still felt good at this point, but noticed I was 8 second slow compared to my wanted pace. 

Picked up the speed a bit and saw my heartrate starting to increase. Was prepared for the worst coming in towards the 6k mark, as I hear that 6-8 should usually be the toughest, after the 8 you are starting to be able to rely on adrenaline. However, the pain never came. Passed 7k without feeling that bad at all. Still hard, but not brain-screaming hard. Decided to increase my pace, but went a bit too quick for 500m so needed to slow down again to burn myself out. 8km came and went, and I felt really strong and knew I would be able to complete this in sub-45. So now the question was just how fast will it really be.

Tried to steadily increase my pace to feel when the body would tell me to stop, but it never really said stop. Passed the 9km mark and saw my HR monitor shining bright-red, but I felt incredible, so I decided to give it my all and not look at the watch. The last 500m was really tough though as I sprinted towards my imaginary goal post. At 100m remaining my body told me to slow down, but managed to keep the speed all over the end line. Paused my watch and saw the end time: 44:28 according to my Polar watch. (44.23 according to Strava).

SO FREAKING PROUD AND HAPPY over what I accomplished during this spring and summer. And so excited for what's next. Either I will go for a sub-20 5k attempt or try to continue shave seconds / minutes off my 10k time. 

Since I managed to go so much faster the last 1km I feel that I should be able to keep a bit higher average pace throughout the race if I go for fully even splits instead.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I don't have a specific running goal, but would like to structure my running somehow with a plan or something. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I am a crossfitter, but have been getting more and more into running during the past year and a half. During most of my first year of running it was solely about getting out there. My only criteria for success was that the run happened, no matter how short or slow it was. Had great success with it and came to enjoy my little break outside. 

Then during lockdown, I felt like I needed a goal and signed up for a half marathon. I was really thriving with a training plan and had a lot of fun with it. But then two things happened. 

1.  I got a job. Now I'm away for 10 hours a day (incl. commute) and I still want to keep up my crossfit training and spend time with my husband and dog. So fitting in running has been more of a challenge. 
2. The half marathon got cancelled due to Covid. Without the goal of the half marathon and with the increase in stress due to work, I no longer felt motivated to keep up with the training plan. 

Now I have had time to adjust to the new job and everything and I would like to start running more again. Ideally 1-2 times a week, but I have no idea how to even structure it. I enjoyed the longer runs on the weekends, but I don't know if I should keep increasing the distance each week or just choose a distance between 10-15 km and do that every weekend. And then maybe go for a 5 during the week? Or should I choose something to work on? Speed or distance? And how do I choose what to work on first? 

Even though I am in good shape from crossfit, I am a slow runner because I am more of the weightlifting type of athlete where it pays to be a little heavier. My long runs are usually run at pace 7.10/km and a fast run would be anywhere between 6.00 and 6.30/km. My longest run to date has been 16 km.

I've been a competitive endurance athlete most of my life. I was an elite rank triathlete back in the day and switched to pro-am cycling before I took a hiatus on all of that for a few years due to school. 

For the last 6 months I have been struggling with SEVERE forefoot pain after about 10 minutes that turns my run from something like a tempo run to now intervals due to having to stop from pain in the forefoot in both of my feet. I run about 8 minute miles at training pace. I run 6-7 minute miles  at a 5k pace. 

When I was a triathlete my feet occasionally got pretty sore after races but nothing like this where it is like a sharp pain.

* Adidas Solar Boost - Decently tolerable
* Asics Cumulus - Decently Tolerable, Kept - my current go-to.
* Nike Zoom Fly - Mediocre, Kept
* Hoka Evo Carbon (Returned)
* On Cloud, worsened (Returned)
* Mizuno Wave Rider, worsened (Returned) 

I'm doing \~2 miles only, and my normal run is 2-3.5 miles anyway. I take at least 2 days off after each run. I wear Adissage sandals at home after the run if my feet are sore.

I've been to a podiatrist but I think it wasn't the best one becuase it seemed to be a very high volume office with almost exclusively elderly folks.

2658,2658,2658,31,Can I get to a sub 20 5k with 30-35 km/w?,1599895468,"&amp;#x200B;

**Quick Background** 

I have recently achieved a PR of 21:38 with mostly 35-45 km weeks and some moderate speed work. I have been **trying to maintain 50 km/w**  for 8 weeks before adding serious speed work in, **but keep failing to do so after the third or fourth week.** 

Due to the pandemic I only have the opportunity to run in my neighborhood which is full of inclined streets and irregular terrain. 

As a consequence I take a significant toll on my tendons and muscles. The last three weeks for instance, I decided only to do easy runs, with zero speed work, and was able to achieve 50k on every one of them. 

Unfortunately, however, and as has been usual every time I have attempted this during the pandemic, my IT band has started hurting, my knees have begun to trigger discomfort, and I am being forced to bring my volume down again for 10-15 days or so. 

I really believe this pain is related to the terrain, due to the fact that before the pandemic I never had this issue and was running only slightly less volume on the track. **The track is unfortunately closed, and will remain so for some time.** 

So my question is: is it possible to bring down my 5k time below 20 min if I add serious and high quality speed work once or twice a week, but only maintain a base of 30-35 km/w?

Until my bike wound up in the shop today and I set out for a 6-mile walk. The last time I tried to run I made it about two blocks before I thought my knees, lungs and feet would explode. Even though I could spin for an hour like a banshee, that exercise didn’t translate into running at all. Well, tonight, 55 minutes into my walk I got this urge to pick up my pace.

I made the mile in a blistering 10:29 but I felt pretty good, and topped it off with a 3-mile walk/cool down if you will. 

I cycle about 100 miles weekly and had entertained doing an Olympic aquabike. Now I have a triathlon on my mind. If I can just get to 6 miles in the running department, the bike and the swim are no problem. I used to love running when I was a youngster.

I've using running as exercise for a very long time (middle school up to now, my junior year of HS) but I've been forced to limit my running because of a recurring issue.

(\*I run using the balls of my feet, just in case anyone was wondering\*)

I am a decently active runner looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds for running, erging, and general use but mainly for running. I had the Soundcore Liberty Air 2s and while they were decent for normal use they would not stay in my ear when running and have been horribly inconsistent overall. I am looking to replace them and it seems like the Elite Active 75t and Vista are the two to decide between. I sweat a good bit so they need to be able to stand up to that, and I'd like to be able to run in the rain. Finally, the downside I saw to the Vistas was that they didn't autoplay/pause when taken in or out of the ear (and less battery), while the downside of the Elite Active 75t I saw was that they only allow for independent use of the right earbud.

I started running somewhat ironically (you’ll see) because I got injured. I was lifting weights for a few years, and had a freak accident on the playground with my kids and broke my elbow. I can’t not be working toward something, so I tried running while rehab-ing by elbow. Again, somewhat ironically, it’s been 13 months since that accident and I still can’t do a push-up, but that’s another issue.

My first running goal was a 25m 5k. I ran too hard every run, e.g intervals in my first weeks of training. Within 2 months, I was at PT for hip pain. Over-striding with a crossover, easy fix. And I reached my goal (24:15).

My second goal was a 2 hour half-marathon. I followed a training plan, but didn’t have the base/strength to support it. Within another 2 months, I was at PT for knee pain. Inadequate/not firing glutes. 3 months of managing the pain through training, and the race pushed me over the edge, full blown ITBS. But I reached my goal again (1:57:04)!

So I learned my lesson and took a couple months to cross-train and recover. Coming back, I’m “doing everything right”, ready to base build into the fall.. my only goal being to build safely to and sustain 20 miles per week. I want to train RIGHT in my second year of running.

- Every run easy (conversational).
- Rolling more days than not.
- Yoga once a week.
- 2-3 strength sessions per week.
- Evaluated gait; no inconsistencies.
- Build mileage slowly.

It’s been 5 months since the half marathon and I’m finally back to a measly 15 miles per week. And I’m injured again.

PT says overuse (what!!). I have very high arches, and supports I put in in January were causing my ankle to roll out and hurt. So I took them out a few months ago while cross-training and now my foot AND ankle are killing me. It’s been almost a month without running and I can’t take it anymore. The PT gave me some ankle exercises to do, but I’m not sure how much more “recovery” I can commit to.

I don’t know why after such an awful year of running I’m even bothering anymore. I’ve watched countless hours of videos, been to countless hours of PT, massage, and gait training, and have had enough great runs to really know what I’m missing. And man, after a year, it feels hopeless. All I want to do is run!",running,Octowned,False,/r/running/comments/iqxkaz/my_frustrating_first_year_of_running/
2706,2706,2706,82,I called the cops on a lady this morning.,1599852640,"I’ve been training for my first marathon and running at the local junior college at 5am. It’s pretty well lit, there is very little traffic, a good 1 mile and 2 mile route. Throughout the week there are quite a few folks that run there and I’ve become accustomed to seeing their vehicles and such. Mostly women in their 40’s and a couple guys like me around 30. 

This morning though, there was a woman, a regular to the pre-dawn run, running about 1/4 mile ahead of me and someone walking down the middle of the street near the dorms. I thought at first it might have been a student but what kind of college student would be up, in the street, dressed in jeans and a hoodie at 0500? As I got closer, I realized it was a woman in her 50’s or so. 

Got a weird vibe as I went by her. I said good morning and she just watched me from about 6 feet away. 

A couple laps later I came between 2 buildings and caught something out of the corner of my eye. As I looked to my right, Lurker Lady just kind of appeared out of the shadows in the corner of a building. Not a sidewalk there. Not a door. Just hanging out in the shadows. That’s what did it for me. If I feel creeped out, I’m sure these other 4-5 women around here do too. 

So I called the local PD. First I explained that I was breathing hard because I was running. I gave them a good description of the lady and let them handle it. About 1/2 mile later, a couple squad cars showed up and immediately spotted the woman, pulled over, and the last I saw, were talking to her. I’m unsure of the outcome but I didn’t see Ms. Sneak anymore. 

That area is a safe space for folks to go exercise in the pre-dawn hours. The women out there deserve to feel safe.

It can give you heat stroke.

At the 2018 Peachtree Road Race (10k) in Atlanta, it was in the low to mid 70s Fahrenheit the morning of the race and 90% humidity. I was trying to hit my first sub-40-minute 10k and went out pretty fast during the first half of the race... and that's all I remember until I woke up in the hospital. Turns out I collapsed 100 yards from the finish line after slowing down from the low 6s per mile to like 9 minutes per mile. I was rushed to the medical tent and then soon after to the hospital. Apparently I was hysterical in the ambulance and was yelling and screaming a lot and really scared my wife who rode with me. I remember literally none of this.

I woke up in the hospital and was told that I pushed myself too hard, that I had heat stroke, and that a ton of my blood work came back with levels very out of the normal ranges. Scary stuff. I was confused by all this because I had trained pretty hard and in similar weather and had never ever come close to blacking out or anything like that. I knew there was something missing. The doctors just shrugged it off and chalked it up to me being out of shape and not knowing my limits.

A few weeks after getting home from the hospital, my wife, a medical student at the time, remembered that [antihistamines combined with exercise can lead to heat stroke](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/antihistamine-decongestant-and-anticholinergic-combination-oral-route/precautions/drg-20069979).

I went out for my standard short run, I had the day off and it was my kids first day back at school so I was feeling pretty great about having time to myself.

About a mile in I lost balance and basically rolled my entire foot, while training to regain balance I accidentally put all the weight on that side of my foot and heard the pop. 

Pain immediately. I guess through adrenaline I didn’t think it was THAT BAD there was no need to call anyone to make them go out of their way to pick me up, so I walked the mile back to my car. Then took my shoe off to my oh shit moment where I saw a pretty nice size BUMP on the side of my foot. Well that’s not good, doesn’t match my other foot. 

When I got home I guess that’s when the pain came back because I couldn’t walk on it.

I work at home too, so this means I don’t see much of things outside my window. Oh and guess what they are doing at work right now to motivate us? Doing a virtual marathon that I planned to kick ass in. 

Luckily my friend invited me to her book club and I do have a college course I am taking which does help.

So my question is, should I be doing long runs at race pace or not? The reason I have been doing this so far is that I'm guessing such training plans are for people who have already ran half marathons before, and you dont run at race pace because the thought is race day adrenaline and pushing yourself can get your pace a bit lower. But my worry is that my longest run before race day is 10 miles, so I will need my race day push just to get me those last 3 miles, and I'm not really sure I'll have enough in me on race day to both run faster than I am used to running AND three miles further.

As I hit the last 1/10th of a mile of my planned distance with my heart pumping, chest burning, and legs screaming, something new happened.  

As I came to that place where the root has grown under the asphalt, I went to step over it like I have a million times before.  Only this time, my foot went into it instead of over it.  I've never tripped on a run before, despite years of running.  In the split second I was airborne before hitting the ground, several thoughts went through my head:

1.  I think I tripped on that root
2.  Yep, definitely tripped on that root
3.  I've always hated that root
4.  I'm going to hit the ground
5.  I wonder if this is going to hurt?

Similarly, once I landed, several more thoughts popped into my head:

1. I yelled really loud.  That probably woke up the people in that house, and they are going to look out here and see me falling
2.  I'm sliding on the ground.  That answers the question about if this will hurt.
3.  Wait.  Did this hurt?
4.  Yep.  This hurt.

I jumped up as quickly as I could, determined to finish my distance.  The adrenaline gave my an extra boost, and  I still finished with my best-ever time. Then I began hobbling back home, trying to decide if I could milk this for a day off work or not (decided no).

Perhaps the best part was when my daughter woke up and saw me cleaning up the road rash.  She has recently taken up running but wasn't with me today.  She looked at me with a smirk and said ""when it hurts, we just get tougher and stronger."" :)

Been running now for about 4 months and about 1,5 month ago I went to a running store to buy a pair of new shoes. It was the full package, 3d scans of my feet and then I got to try on lots of shoes on the treadmill and analyze footage of how my feet landed during my run. I knew already that I over pronate and the shoes I already had was a pair of Nike Zoom Structures but seeing how my feet landed in a pair of neutral shoes was eye opening. It looked almost as if they would break from the impact since I landed so much on the inside of my feet. I bought a pair of stable Under Armor shoes. 

Then I started coming across information that stable shoes are more a marketing thing than a actual necessity and I'm confused. I've tried to find good information about this but I can't seem to find anything conclusive. 

I've never (afaik) had any problems caused by my over pronation and I wear regular shoes on a day to day basis. I've noticed however that shoes with a too soft heel causes my feet to slip inwards while walking. 

Does anyone have any information on this topic? Would really love to buy a pair of neutral shoes since they're often easier to find at a good price and they generally look much better.

43F, 5’11” 155.  Been running since March, anywhere from 1-4x/wk.  My primary sport is on-the-water rowing, which I’ve been doing off and on since 1996; very seriously since May.  

I would consider myself to be in pretty good shape.  A normal row is 13-17K per session, a normal run is between 6 and 12K.  Juuust got a HRM, so I can’t really speak to what my HRs are at different levels of effort.  

PR 5K (on flat ground but in the heat) is 27:19, and I can keep my 5K time around 9:05-9:10/mi pretty consistently.  I’d like to get my 5K down closer to 25-26:00 so I can start thinking about that sub-2hr HM.  Running faster than 8:30 for more than a mile or so seems pretty out of reach, though.  My best ever 2mile is 17:30ish.  

Between March and now I’ve brought my 5K splits down from 11:00+/mi, but I seem to have plateaued.  And at longer distances — 10K+, I have trouble breaking that 10:00/mi barrier.

2790,2790,2790,71,Training for a marathon. How is it possible that I'm putting on weight?,1599779782,"All they way back in February I got this idea in my head that I should try and run a marathon this year. Up to that point I've only been running occasionally, usually once a week doing rarely more than about 5k. Initially I just started increasing that distance slightly, but by April I actually got a proper training plan with the aim to run the marathon in October. I now run 4 times a week, averaging between 40-50k per week.

The most unexpected part in all this is that I've put on weight. I thought I might put on a little in the short term as I build up muscle but eventually it would even out or I'd lose weight with all that extra running. However I've continually put on weight all the way through. Not much for sure, I've gone from 79kg to 82kg. Still, this is really puzzling and it has been constant all the way through. While I don't have a diet plan, I do think I was careful to not eat more or worse food when I started training.

The one thing that may have made an impact is that I used to do a lot of cycling. I've cut down on that somewhat since I spend so much time running now. But I think the running I'm doing now is physically a lot more demanding than the cycling I did. My cycling is always more ""excursion"" than ""training"".

2795,2795,2795,76,"Any males over age 50 that can break 6 minute mile. If so, what is your weight and height ?",1599777828,"I am a 52 y.o. male who briefly ran in college prior to getting injured.  I did pull off a 4:13 mile coming off of soccer season my freshman year ( age 19) I was 5’10” and 135-140 lbs, back then..

Fast forward 30 plus years.. I am now 5’10” and 195 lbs.. 17 percent body fat by DEXA which is the most accurate way of measuring body fat (it includes 4 percent essential body fat)... Per the technician, who has done thousands of measurements, the lowest body fat he has ever seen was 10 percent, and the guy was a roadmap of vessels. 

Anyway, I am running 30 to 35 mpw, and usually have one tempo a week (20 minutes, short break , and then 10 minutes ) , along with strides 2 to 3 days a week .  I don’t have anyone to train with, but the fastest mile on my own was 7:07.. I suspect I am touch faster as wasn’t in competition, but damn, it’s hard not to compare that 7 minute mile to what was my conversational pace back at age 19.

So I do realize we get slower as we age, and getting fatter is likely one of the biggest culprits - decreasing VO2 max as weight is in the denominator in that metric, not to mention overall power to mass.. I looked at Daniel’s book, and I think he put me now as an intermediate runner based on age. However, based on my previous time of 4:13,, factoring in age, my time should be around 5:00 now , if I were the same level of fitness as I was at age 19 (advanced) 

So I am thinking that even if I were to introduce some serious interval sessions, I doubt I could break 6:00, at my current weight.. Even if I were to shed the extra 7 percent body fat to get down to 10 percent body fat - 180 pounds ( which would put me closer to Usain Bolt’s BMI )I still don’t think I could break 6 minute mile despite evidence of previous genetics. I think it really boils down to overall BMI, which for a middle/ long distance runner should be under 24, and for me, that would mean losing a fair amount of muscle, as well as fat, as 180 lbs would only put me around 25.5 BMI. 

Anyone around my age, height and weight  breaking  a 6 minute mile these days ? I will cut myself some slack , in that apparently according to the US military , if you are 50 and can break 7:12 , you are in the top 1 percent of your age group..

Anyway, I was walking my dogs along the beach, when one of them decided it was a good idea to follow a seal out to sea. He's a weird dog, and I know him well, and by the time he was ~250m out I new he wasn't going to turn around and come back. 

So, like any other dog owner would, I stripped down to my boxers and swam out with his lead after him. I eventually caught up to him about 600m from the beach, with said seal and a couple of cormorants. At that point I could tell he knew he had fucked up - he was clearly agitated and tired.

I know that without the fitness I've built up after the last few months of regular running I would not have been able to make it out to him.

I start with a 5 minute warm-up walk and stretch for 5-7 minutes when I get home. In the evenings I do yoga at home or take a ballet class. I'm on day 25 of a 30-day yoga challenge.  

Problem - I noticed my hip/core/back weakness and imbalance make my low back and glutes sore and tired. Proper running form and yoga has helped some, but it's time to really focus and address this. I was considering switching out a few yoga days in favor of pilates. I also have a squat rack w/ Olympic bar, bench, and some resistance bands. I used to love lifting heavy things but as I've gained so much weight, I find it uncomfortable and stressful on my joints. I haven't tried after my current weight loss.

I am a relatively new runner, 22 years, 73kg male. 

I'm running with mi band and I have bpm near 175-185 during runs (bpm slowly increasing during first 10 minutes until steady plateau at 175-185) , even when I try to run what seems is 'slow' for me, 8-9 km/h. I checked pulse by myself and it's definitely near 180bpm, so mi band isn't wrong. 

I cant say that I have a lot of discomfort though, it's tough but as much as it should be, I think. No pains no winded feelings. 

And as far as it seems from the Internet my bpm should be near 160, not even close to 180. 

So should I 'overrun' it? or check again my running technique? Or try to run even slower (because run slower is kinda uncomfortable for my body, it feels more like ""jumping"") 

Or maybe it's okay for average person to have so high bpm in first weeks of running?

My mental health then dropped &amp; I pretty much stopped doing any physical activity for an entire year. When I started high school I joined the cross country team to get back into running, but I started experiencing problems I hadn’t before. I would get a tight, aching/burning pain in my calves (around the sides &amp; back). Cross country was unenjoyable for a year because I was in pain &amp; couldn’t keep up. I was told by my school coach that it was shin splints. I quit running after that year, but in the past couple years I‘ve been trying to get back into it. Everytime I try to start, I get that same pain. I stretch before &amp; after each work out. I try to start slow (1 mile) but the pain always starts up around 0.25 of the mile. I usually just push through it for the full mile. 

I’ve tried many different running shoes. I’ve tried running on different terrains (paths, roads, the beach). I’ve tried resting for a day or two in between runs but it’s always there when I come back. I’ve tried just pushing myself through it &amp; ran everyday for a couple weeks, but it got worse each day. Eventually it got to the point where when I was climbing the stairs to my apartment after a run, my legs collapsed. The only advice I’ve received is to just switch to another form of cardio like biking, but I don’t wanna give up on running.

2841,2841,2841,23,Two questions about base training,1599752396,"Hey all, a couple of questions about base training from a relatively new runner. 

  
\*\*Background\*\*

Mid 20s female, involved in sports since childhood. Used to row in university, had a good aerobic base. Would randomly run 10-15km at a time due to aforementioned aerobic base, and quickly developed tibial stress fractures from  my comically long strides and heel-striking. Didn't touch running again for about 5 years. Was quite serious about strength development in the meantime, built a lot of muscle and got very strong. Did occasional aerobic exercise like running stairs, spinning, and hiking to keep from potato-ing. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Current\*\*  
Decided to try running this winter (before COVID, actually!), and built up mileage very conservatively to avoid re-injury. Altered my form massively, did lots of ankle/calf prehab, and things are going really well. I run about 40-50km/week, generally 3 long, slow runs and 1 tempo run. My goal is to run a sub-2 (we're talking 1:59:59) half marathon in about 2 months. Able to hold that pace for about half the distance right now, so it seems feasible.   


\*\*QUESTIONS\*\*

1) \*Does your base speed decrease over time?\* I've been running 40+ km/week for about 2-3 months, and I can't really detect much of a difference in my easy pace. I truly respect the LSD training (this was my favourite back when I was rowing), and will go the entire distance at HR 140-145ish. This ends up being a 6:15-6:45km/min, depending on the heat, hills, and how I'm feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) \*How the heck does base training work?\* Essentially, what boggles me is this: in rowing, the races are generally 2km. We would build our aerobic base (""base of the pyramid"", ""aerobic engine"", whatever analogy you want to use) with training that is much longer than race distance at much lower intensities. What confuses me about half-marathon training is that \*I am building my base with training shorter than the race distance.\* I.e. it's typical to never run more than 16km or so when training for a 21km race. How does running easy for 16km support me running moderately hard for 21km? The visual ""pyramid"" analogy falls apart. I understand that the answer may be too complex to type out, so video or article links are welcome.

# Best for running

&gt; [**Balega Hidden Comfort**](https://imgur.com/e0204IS)

&gt; No matter how far we ran, and no matter the temperature, the Balega Hidden Comfort excelled. Amazing blister resistance and great cushioning, although a little on the thick side. Made in South Africa.

&gt; [£13 at Wiggle (UK)](https://www.wiggle.co.uk/balega-hidden-comfort-socklets)

The **Balega Hidden Comfort** socks are an internet darling for good reason: They stood above all others as running socks in our testing. No matter how far we ran in them, they exhibited stellar blister resistance and comfort. They were reliable, and durable. I’ve had pairs for upwards of two years — two years of multiple runs and washes per week — and they’re still holding up well, except for some light pilling. If I am getting ready for a run I instinctively reach for the Balegas.

The Balegas are on the thicker side compared to many other socks we tested. So much so that we were initially a little put off. However, anything thinner we tested ended up giving blisters in longer or hotter runs. Although they are thicker, the compromise in thickness is ultimately worth the gain in cushioning and long-term comfort. The material wicked sweat well and dried out quickly after removing your shoes post run.

Balega manufactures their socks in Cape Town, South Africa. Beyond reducing water consumption by ​“[up to 50%](https://balega-socks.implus.com/the-balega-socks-difference)”, Balega does not appear to have made huge efforts in improving its sustainability. It’s also disheartening to see Balega is owned by a big company that is in turn owned by a private equity firm, but it’s hard to argue with a product this good.

# What to look for

**Material:** The most important aspect and a defining factor of a sock. For socks worn in the heat, lightness and airiness are desirable. There are a large variety of materials used in socks such as cotton, wool, nylon, polyamide, and elastane among others. Cotten and linen do not perform well in hot, sweaty conditions, get wet easily and take a long time to dry. Given the more technical nature of many of these socks they tend to use synthetic fibres.

**Cushioning:** How much padding separates your foot from the (insole of the) shoe. The level of cushioning is inversely proportional to the thickness of the sock — the lighter the sock material, the less cushioning there is.

**Blister resistance:** A combination of cushioning, texture and density of weave/​material and placement of panels on the sock (if any). This mostly came into play when it came to running, particularly in distances longer than 5 kilometres.

**Sweat wicking:** How well the sock removed perspiration from your foot. A key point of consideration for a pair of summer socks and a couple of other use cases such as wearing boots.

**Time to dry:** How fast the socks will dry if they get wet — mainly with sweat but also when they get washed. Especially relevant in summer.

**Compression:** How compressive or tight fitting the socks are. Striking a balance is hard — too loose and the sock falls down, too tight and it becomes uncomfortable.

**Seams:** Where different panels of the sock attach to one another. These seams can sometimes cause irritation if they are not high quality or are in awkward places where they will be felt on your foot. Particular attention should be paid to the toe box. This wasn’t an issue in most of the socks we tested.

**Origin:** Where the socks are made. Many premium socks are made in developed countries. Cheaper socks tended to be made in Asia. Socks’ origins were more diverse than our other guides.

**Transparency:** How forthcoming the company that makes the socks is about their factory conditions. Being made in a developed country doesn’t automatically mean a factory’s conditions are good, and being made in a developing country doesn’t necessarily mean their conditions are poor. We used Good On You, a fashion brand transparency directory, to augment our research.

**Company history:** Has the brand been bought and sold, or is it independent? If a company has been acquired, who acquired it, and what other companies are in the acquirer’s portfolio? All things equal, preference is given to independent brands.

**Cut/​length:** How high the sock comes up on the leg. We looked at two main cuts: ankle and calf (or ​“crew”) cuts.

**Aesthetics:** Designs, graphics, logos, colours — we hate them all. Strong preference was given to socks with minimal details and available in plain colours.

**Durability:** Socks were worn on many walks of varying length, and on multiple 5 and 10 kilometre runs. They were washed on hot and air dried multiple times.

**Price:** Other than at the very cheap end, there was surprisingly little variation in pricing for mid to high-end socks. Most pairs tested fell between $12 and $20.

**Purpose:** Many socks are created with specific purposes in mind, such as running, cycling, hiking, and so on. We didn’t have preconceived notions about what purpose would work best for summer (casual use or sports use), so we tested a range.

**Availability:** We favoured socks in stock year round, that were part of a permanent collection, and available internationally. Notably a few brands were USA specific and were difficult to acquire outside the States.

# How we tested

A lot has been written online about socks, so we started there. 6 subreddits provided most of the recommendations: r/​malefashionadvice ([post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2lqgue/quality_everyday_socks_to_buy_lots_of/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/ae2ck0/best_socks_for_quality/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8y041c/your_favorite_for_socks/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8k6zb9/what_are_the_best_year_round_socks_to_get/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/29q0wz/can_we_have_a_giant_thread_on_the_best_brands_for/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1biz07/a_guide_to_socks/)), r/​running ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cp7zzm/running_socks_recommendations/)), r/​advancedrunning ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/bubpng/best_running_socks_for_long_runs/)), r/​youshouldknow ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/7f1pcf/ysk_you_should_know_about_merino_wool_socks/)), r/​cycling ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/cr50qp/cycling_socks/)), and r/​bicycling ([post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/3erxhk/cycling_socks/), [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/18el6x/good_cycling_socks/)). We also researched what people were searching for on Google (mostly Nike). From these we compiled a short list of socks we wanted to buy and test. We bought every pair with our own money.

We weren’t sure what type of sock would work well in summer conditions, so we tried a range of different types of socks. That meant trying socks made for a range of different sports and purposes: running, cycling, hiking, etc.

We concentrated on two main cuts of sock, a mid calf (~5 inch) and an ankle cut. We tried to test at least these two from each brand, but that wasn’t always possible.

The socks we tested were worn on long and short walks in the London summer. Temperature varied wildly, but it did include a 35°C (95°F) heat wave! On these long walks, we judged how cool or hot feet felt, how comfortable feet remained over the course of the walk, and if there was any rubbing against the inside of the shoes worn. It should be noted that for the walking tests, socks were mostly worn with sneakers (specifically the Novesta Star Master — runner up in our [best low-top canvas sneakers guide](https://www.typicalcontents.com/articles/the-best-unisex-white-canvas-sneakers-under-80-gbp)).

Socks were also tested for running on short to medium distances of 5 – 15 kilometres. If socks tested well at those distances, they were tested on longer runs of around 20 kilometres. For running, socks were primarily judged first for their blister resistance, secondly for their ability to keep feet feeling cool and thirdly for their ability to dry quickly after becoming wet.

Socks were washed multiple times in hot washes with detergent and fabric softener (probably against manufacturer guidelines, but who has time for that) and air dried.

All socks that were tested were rotated through over the course of two to three months, and continue to be tested today. We will update this guide if anything noteworthy comes up in the future.

# The competition

The **Balega Ultralight Crew** socks are part of Balega’s lightest range, and they certainly were light and airy feeling on foot. They were comfortable on the foot, and had decent blister resistance (I actually ran a 5 kilometer personal best in them). Their lightness did make them feel less supportive than other socks, and they exhibited a strange, chemical smell out of the box but that faded after the first wash. Unfortunately, the Balega Ultralight Crew get a failing grade on aesthetics. They are horrendously ugly, with bizarre, pseudo-technical patterns on the foot area. At least these designs are relegated to the foot and remain mostly unseen with sneakers on. Make no mistake, this is a good, lightweight sock. But the sub par looks took them out of the running for us.

The **CDLP Bamboo Socks** came in a beautiful off-white colour and with minimal styling that really appealed to us. The bamboo material maintained a dry feeling even after long walks. Unfortunately however, the socks had an annoying tendency to fall down over time, giving them an untidy look, which was a deal breaker for us.

The **CEP Compression Low Cut Socks 3.0** were unsurprisingly very compressive. They were on the lighter side of socks we tested. They didn’t have enough cushioning for decent length runs, and their blister resistance wasn’t great. They have their logo placed obnoxiously on the top of the (ankle length) sock, meaning half of the logo will peak over your shoe. Interestingly, the socks are manufactured in Germany, the only pair in our testing to originate from there. CEP is a subsidiary of a medical company called Medi, who specialise in compression wear for medical situations.

The **Darn Tough Coolmax Vertex No Show Tab Ultra-Light Cushion** is comparable in many ways to our top pick for best running socks, the Balega Hidden Comfort. They tested nearly as well as our top pick, and cost $1 more. They are thicker than we would have preferred in a sock for use in the heat, especially considering they are marketed as ​“ultra-light”. All that aside, they were very comfortable, quite compressive (in a reassuring way), well made, and dried quickly. If the Balega Hidden Comfort socks are out of stock, consider these instead.

**Darn Tough’s Element Crew Light Cushion** were some of the hardest socks in our shortlist to track down in Europe, being sold out almost everywhere. We found them thick for ​“light” socks, overly so for summer wear. They were thick enough that they could cause issue in some shoes, particularly tighter fitting sneakers. We liked their retro tennis sock styling though

The **DeFeet Aireater 1″ Speede Sock** was originally one of our top picks, being the lower cut cousin of our top pick. We later discovered that the availability of this model was poor in some areas. Additionally DeFeet do not appear to be offering this model in solid colourways anymore. For these reasons we removed it as a pick.

The **Feetures Elite Ultra Light Running Sock – No Show Tab** were incredibly tight fitting, especially considering we bought the large size, and when they come out of a wash you may think they will never fit on your feet again. But when you do squeeze your pins into these socks you’ll be greeted by one of the lightest socks in our testing. They are so light that every crevice and seam in your shoe will be felt. This means they offer essentially zero cushioning and blister resistance. They also had a frilly tab around the ankle opening which is meant to be used as a tab to pull on and off the socks but ends up making them feel akin to a little girl’s socks.

The **Icebreaker Multisport Ultra Light Micro Socks** were not available in white, which was a bit of a downer to start on. They are an extremely light and airy feeling sock that wicks sweat and dries very quickly. They did fit large, and we would advise sizing down (I am a UK10 and bought a large, but would advise a medium). In fact they are so light that I could plainly see my toes through the material when I wore the socks! This lack of material meant the cushioning left a lot to be desired, and worried us in regards to durability (although they have had no issues in our testing to date).

Alongside our running pick, the **Inijiji Ultra Run No-Show** are another darling of internet fitness communities. For those not in the know, they are toe socks, meaning each of your individual toes are wrapped in material, like a glove for your feet. This is said to prevent you from getting blisters. Personally I found the sensation of toe socks off-putting and strange. The sock material was high quality, with good blister resistance on par with our top running pick. The padding was good and the sock has a somewhat compressive feeling that was reassuring and supportive. Putting on the Inijijis was fiddly, and when taking them off I thought I was going to rip my toes off as they gripped my toes tightly. Additionally the toe sizing didn’t line up well with the length of my toes, some being too short and others too long (maybe I have weird toes though). Finally, and I would argue more importantly, they look terrible both because of the toe sock design but also because of the tacky graphics plastered on the sock. You will be judged for wearing these. Having said that, if you want to channel your big dad energy on a run, these are the socks for you.

The **Muji Right Angle Rib Stitch Short Socks** were a beacon of minimal design in a sea of overlogo-ed, over branded, garish socks. They have a beautiful, understated style. They look great. However we didn’t find them well suited to warmer weather, and they didn’t stand out in terms of quality or performance. Muji talk about how their socks have a ​“right-angled” design, but in practice the benefit was subtle at best. These socks are rock bottom in terms of pricing. But with this comes some questionable (or at least opaque) manufacturing practices. For reference, Good On You rates Muji as ​“not good enough” in its company directory.

The **Nike Sportswear Essential** socks were much too thick and warm for summer. Our feet remained hot from the moment they were put on and it was a relief to take them off. They also felt wet when feet were particularly sweaty. We did appreciate their retro and relatively minimal styling however. Due to misplacing the label the socks came with, we have been unable to determine the country of origin. Fashion transparency database Good On You rate Nike as ​“it’s a start”.

The **Organic Basics SilverTech Active Ankle Socks** were scratchy feeling and were sheer when worn (I could see my toes through the material), which quickly discounted them. However the branding, design, packaging and presentation were brilliant, and we loved the mission, sustainability and transparency that Organic Basics showed.

The best pair of tennis style socks we tested were the **Organic Basics SilverTech Active Tennis Socks**. They were much more comfortable and soft feeling than the other pairs of tennis style socks we tried. However they were too thick to recommend as a summer sock, and we feel cotton is a poor choice of material for this too. Organic Basics did an amazing job in presenting their brand and mission, which we are big fans of.

The **Smartwool Phd Run** socks are a medium weight sock we tested. They were too warm feeling for hot weather, although they were also very soft and dried quickly when wet. We really didn’t like the design on our pair: a red smartwool logo on the back at the top of the sock, and grey panels on the ankle and toe area really disrupted the otherwise white sock.

The **Swiftwick Aspire One** socks were a good all round pair of socks available in a huge range of cuff lengths. They were fairly light feeling, reassuringly compressive and comfortable, and had relatively restrained styling. The cuff is well designed with not excess material, and kept the sock up. The red ​“L” and ​“R” lettering on each sock is a nice detail. However the Switwick just doesn’t compare in terms of comfort or performance to our running pick, and wasn’t as comfortable as our casual pick.

The **Uniqlo Pile Socks** were some of the thickest in our testing. This gave them very high amounts of cushioning which was pleasant. However their material caused feet to sweat profusely and didn’t let out any of the moisture generated.

**Uniqlo’s Pile Mesh Short Socks** were thick and large fitting. The large fit meant they weren’t particularly comfortable when worn in tighter fitting sneakers. We found them to be quite hot feeling, causing feet to sweat more than usual and making the socks uncomfortable. As with Uniqlo’s other socks, we did like their minimal detailing and their affordable pricing.",running,typical-contents,False,/r/running/comments/iq2uxa/i_bought_and_tested_20_pairs_of_socks/

So, this past weekend I attended two childrens birthday parties (I have a six month old son, I’m not a creep) and a big three course meal with my buddies. Needless to say, there was some serious overeating.

When running, I feel like my pace is the same as the previous week but the tracker clearly says otherwise. Only difference is that I get more tired in the end of the run.

Have I lost my pace? Or is my fitness tracker unreliable all of a sudden? Is it caused by poor sleep due to having a small baby? Just thought I’d point out that there has been no weight gain, I actually dropped from ~82 kg to 80.5 just now.

- Focus on short runs and become as fast as I can, 5k for example
- Focus to increase distance and train for a half marathon or marathon

My freshman year I suffered a grade three ankle sprain due to me being an idiot and not wearing an ankle brace in basketball. I had gone up for a chase down block and landed on the dudes ankle. It took about a month to recover from that sprain. 

My sophomore year I did the same thing, but the unfortunate thing was I was wearing an ankle brace this time. I was doing a hop step in practice and landed on my teammates foot. I had my second grade 3 sprain in 2 years. This time it took around 6 weeks to recover. 

Lastly, my junior year, again, I did a hop step in practice and landed on my teammates foot. I was wearing an ankle brace and high top shoes. I had no clue how it happened but it did. I suffered my third grade 3 sprain in 3 years. 

This time I could not recover without surgery. I went through 2 months of therapy and it did not work, went back for another MRI and my ligaments were completely shredded and no improvement was shown. I suffered my most recent grade three sprain on December 30th, 2019 and had ankle surgery on April 14th, 2020. The ankle surgery consisted of tightening two ligaments and realigning my foot to ease pressure.

Flash forward to September 9th (today). I am preparing myself to absolutely suck in cross country due to me gaining 40 pounds due to me not being able to run. My sophomore year I was running in the 18 minutes pretty comfortably. My fastest time that year was 18:02. I was 135 pounds that year. My junior year I slowed down due to my ankle lacking, but I still was running in the 19s. I need advice as how to get back into running shape and to be able to finish a 5k without stopping. I am accepting the fact I am not going to thrive in cross country, so I am mainly looking for a 6-8 month running plan to help me be competitive in track. In track I run the mile but have never broken the 5 minute barrier. I've been so close at 5:05. I need to run in the 4:40s to be competitive but I am unsure if I can do so due to my current state.

I need tips on how to get back into running, a way to lose 40 pounds before track season (6 months), and a training plan to help me get to that state meet!!

I graduated from therapy yesterday, meaning my balance, technique, strength, and flexibility are all good. Just need that doctor's note 🙌.

TL;DR: Suffered 3 grade three ankle sprains, had ankle surgery, gained 40 pounds, need training plan/advice.

Since I'm not training for anything and am just running for myself and prove that I can in fact run for long(ish) periods of time, is it okay to just keep going by gradually increasing time? I'm not really paying attention to distance under the assumption that speed will come over time, so it would be e.g. 40 min runs every other day this week, 45 next, then 50, etc. Or will this get me into trouble with injuries as the time builds up?

2905,2905,2905,88,Another shoe for a novice runner?,1599693037,"Hello everyone! I’m a novice runner who has started since the global pandemic. 

I think I’ll give a context of my current running-level:
- 25 miles per week ish (6 days a week of running)
- PB for 5k is 23:52
- longest distance ever ran: 6.83 miles/11k
- 5’10 and 165-170 pounds

So here is where I am in a conflict! Around a month ago, my old ultra boost started falling apart, my grandmother bought me a pair of Nike Zoom Fly 3s as a present and I am have ran approximately 85 miles on it as a daily trainer. I have done fartlek, 5k, 10k, intervals and everything on it and I have 0 complaints... yet

I read somewhere that is good to rotate around shoes for better longevity, injury prevention and have some shoes reserved for certain types of running (easy, intervals, etc). I’ve also read that ZF3s are also more of a speed-y shoes that are better for fartlek and intervals? I’m not too sure.

So I guess here’s the question, as a very novice runner who only runs up to 25 miles per week, is it worth getting another pair? Are shoe rotations worth only for people running over 70 miles per hour? 

I’ve been eye-ing on Saucony endorphin speeds (thanks nick bare) but if I am recommended to buy another pair I would love to hear your recommendations! I’ve seen lots of Novablasts and 1080s, Rincons and Kinvara... etc so I would appreciate your recommendations! (Would be even more helpful if you’re heavy like me or do both lifting and running)

Also I am not really into Nike’s anymore because of the Uyghur situation, looking for a slightly more ethical brand. Appreciate it if you have read it util the end.

Just started running regularly this past February after some health issues last year and slowly getting out of shape.  Since February, I've run \~10 miles per week and ran a virtual 5k in June.  Was shooting for under 30 minutes but missed it by around 40 seconds.  Still, I was feeling good and enjoying myself which is all that matters to me.

Since then, the southern summer has picked up and running in low 90's with high humidity has been tough and my times have gone down.  But I've stayed with it just to keep practice and figure I'll be better for it come fall when the temps drop into the 80's.  Well, yesterday after some earlier rains, the temps were in the mid 80's.  Even though yesterday was my scheduled off day, I decided to take advantage of the weather.  Started out faster than normal, felt good through the middle and so I really pushed it at the end and finished at 30:19 for a personal record.  Really wasn't expecting it, but obviously the weather really helps. 

I'll keep pushing and looking for sub-30 minutes to happen this fall, but just thought I'd share my latest achievement.  :

A little back story: I’ve been running about 7 years. I ran 5 and 10k collegiately, and did 50-80 mpw until about 2 years ago, when I tore my meniscus. Then I started traveling a lot, but managed about 30-50 mpw still. I was doing speed workouts 2-3 times a week and was still pretty fast (6:45-7 tempo pace), considering having been on the elliptical for the year prior. 

I was determined to get back into real training at the start of this year and was well on my way, but basically quit running/lifting/riding my bike due to stress with finals/quarantine/getting new job. In the past 5 months, I’ve gained 20-25 pounds. I’m 5’0, so it’s very noticeable. I started running again recently and in my head, I thought it would be more or less like I left it. But it’s far from it. I feel worse than when I first started running years ago. My average pace is 10:00 for 3 miles, which is all I can really do. 

So if you’re wondering how out of shape you can get in 5 months, quit training, start eating like an unrestrained child at a birthday party, start vaping (I’m really REALLY embarrassed about this), and regularly overindulge in beer.

2935,2935,2935,20,Advice for a slow runner,1599675322,"I’ve always been a slow runner and not super athletic in general. 

I started running in my mid 20s following C25K. I enjoyed how it made me feel. Fastest i ever got was 9 min/mile for 5km. I eventually ran a half and full marathon. Pretty slow paces... for the half i think i was around 11:30 min/mile. For the full marathon i ran the first 20 miles at 11-12 min/mile but finished the last 6 miles extremely slow with periods of walking. I trained pretty well following a gal Higdon plan, but probably not quite enough miles/week for the last few weeks and i only slept like 4 hrs the night before (nerves).

I quit running after the full marathon for about a year. 

Since (over last 10 years) , i haven’t really run farther than 5km. I’ve repeated c25k several times (usually 1-2x per year). I usually run for a couple months then take a a couple month long break. I am usually following c25k or running 3-5 times per week (6-12 miles total) with a mix of easy, tempo, Fartlek. 

I have a spin bike and power meter pedals which i trained on for ~6 months before taking a break (peloton powerzone training).

My 2-3 mile run times over the last several years have been 10-12/min miles, averaging in the 11 min/mile range. 

This has been frustration as it seems like everyone else in my age group (late 30s) runs 8-10 min miles without much training. 

I’m 6’2” and my weight will range from 185-200. Currently at 200 lbs now. Averages in the 190s. 

Currently i have about 30-45/mins per day for 5-6 days per week to devote to exercise. 

Any advice on how to improve my pace?


TL;DR:
I’ve always been a slow runner. Used to be a more regimented runner. Not as much time to train nowadays. How can i improve my 5km pace? I’d like to spend 30-45  mins per day running and or spinning.",running,PacoTacoMeat,False,/r/running/comments/iplhjw/advice_for_a_slow_runner/

2937,2937,2937,22,"the running (ongoing) ""running sock"" thread. Favorites, least favorites, and new finds!",1599673745,"When discussing running socks, there are as many options as there are about shoes.  And perhaps what we will find in discussing this is that a sock is a sock is a sock, or more likely there are a number of great sock makers and the differences are slight.

Before we get there, lets break down socks a bit.  You have your ultrathin socks, your medium socks with a bit of padding, and your more thick socks that have more padding.

Some prefer having thick socks, other say if you like the padding get more padded shoes and go with thinner socks.  Some people have feet that fall in the middle of sizes and prefer a larger sock to make the sneaker more snug.

One can see that there are numerous thoughts on buying socks.  Warm weather and cold weather are other thoughts.

So lets start discussing socks and which are your favorites and why.  Back 25 to 30 years ago when I was an actually good runner, I used to love thorlo socks.  But there are so many different sock makers now it gets difficult.

From my limited experience here I seem to see a number of sock makers get mentioned.

Thorlo- A well known and well regarded sock, but perhaps not the best anymore.

Balega- A recent thread here about something to buy that brought in a bunch of hype is this sock

Feetures- Yes, they have feet in their name.  Almost as clever as my use of a running thread about running socks.  But in that recent thread that mentioned Balega, feetures also got prominently mentioned.

Anyways, let me link a recent runner's world article...

I have a number of different socks.  I used to used thorlo a long time ago. 

I have a number of different thorlo socks.  I have some of the ultrathin drymax socks for the summer.  And I have just ordered some Balega and feetures.  I guess I don't have a favorite at the moment.  I am just coming back from a foot injury that laid me up for a number of years.  I know, a long time, but hey, at this point I may have avoided surgery.  

Anyways, curious as to what people here love.  Also, perhaps give people a bit more information like miles a week, and shoe you wear.  This may help people gauge who they may be similar too.

Prior to my injury, about 30-40 miles a week.  Since injury I have increased slowly and painfully to 20 miles a week.  Painfully just because running is tiring.

My question is a common one I know, but I'm not interested in *racing* a 10k. So I'm not looking for a race training plan. I just want to be able to *run* 10 kilometers at an easy pace (currently averaging around 10:50ish/mile. My HS cross country coach is shaking his head in disappointment).

I've read the order of operations document, but it seems strange to me to push adding days before adding mileage. I like running and all, but for now I'm happy with 3 days a week - I'd like to cycle or hike or weight train the other days of the week. Also not interested in bridge to 10K. I used to run XC in high school so I know that intervals have their place in training, but again, not looking to run competitively right now, and it seems to ramp up running too quickly for my comfort.

I can run a 5K in about 33-34 minutes if I pace myself right from the beginning. I know during C25K, we focus on timing more than mileage. I guess my question therefore is - now that I'm done with C25K, should I begin focusing on mileage or keep the time focus? I was thinking it might be easier to just ramp up my time per run by a few minutes a week until I hit 10K?

But my mom just found out ''my over training'' because of my cousin and wants me to stop running. What the hell I am supposed to do now?",1599663297,"So like I started running 4 months ago not with any aim of 'getting fit' or 'losing weight' or any other similar reason. I was just bored as hell in this lockdown so I started it just to cope up with boredom. 

I have a heavy built with naturally more muscle mass than kids my age. So you can imagine me as 17 year old 5'11 guy with big shoulders and an overall fat/ heavy looking body. 

So when I started running, a cousin decided to tag along who is, tbh, has a  pretty average physique and is, a year shorter than me.

 We both had similar stamina of about just 800 meters with a medium or say, slow pace at first.

After a week, we both could hit 1 km distance with the same pace. 

So after this, I realized my weight is an obstacle for me so I also started cutting down my cals a bit  by removing processed food completely form my diet. 

I started seeing results within a week. And that's when things started getting change for both of us. 

Juat after first month, I lost about 5 kgs of fat, gained some muscle mass and could run a 2.5 k in 30 minutes and he was just able to do 1.5 k with the same pace we started with. 

In the 2nd month, I cut down even more carbs from my diet (-600 cals), now on a diet of about 1500 cals and also started doing core and basic strength exercises like pushups, pull ups etc atleast 5 times a week. By the end of month, I was out of the 'fat guy' category, could do a 6.5 k in around 40 minutes. He was able to do a 3k with much lesser pace than me. And then... He just quit. 

Now, from the 3rd month on, I started running alone. Also, my diet had about 90 percent of protein and some healthy fats and some carbs, now just a total of about 700 cals with 3 times more tougher core and strength exercises 4 times a week now and regular running. By the end of this 3rd month, I had freaking abs!! And more defined biceps and triceps and much  stronger chest, core and legs. Also, I could do a 8.5k run in around 45 minutes(as I also focused on my pace this month). 

In the last month, I increased my diet, bit by bit, upto 2000 to 2200 cals with most of the protein and healthy fats and carbs from veg sources( yeah, I am a vegetarian). I also faced some injury due to my own foolishness (I used a torned up pair of shoes for a run, so I hurt my left toe. Also, lower side skin of both my elbows were ripped bady due to doing planks on hard surfaces for many days) but I faced nothing serious. 

But still, I was able to push myself to do a run of 11.2 km in the first 2 weeks and just 3 days ago, ( about 2 weeks after, or after complete 4 months,). I ran a total of 15 km distance in 1 hour and 37 minutes for the first freaking time!!!!!! 

I was, just after the run, so much pumped up to try half marathon after a week's rest ( I was ready to also do some walking after reaching my peak, But I just wanted to do half marathon 's distance at any cost for atleast once!!!) 

That's when shit happened. 

So my cousin, who quit running 2 months ago, wanted to start running once again with me. When I updated him how much I had achieved over that time and how I was preparing to try run a half marathon distance next week, he lost his shit and said I am pushing myself way too much as I also did some heavy dieting. I started bragging about my abs, so I had to tell him about how I also followed about a 700 cal diet for a month. He said it is pretty harmful for me and even after I begged him not to tell about it to my over caring mother, He informed my whole family. It was already hard enough for me to cut calories without my Overcaring mother's attention, now she knows everything. 

My dad is cool about it, warned me to never eat that less again but mom is furious. I doubt that she will let me run ever again. I told her how I have increased my diet much more from about a month as I have to run for longer but she is not buying it.

I was also in soccer. In 5th grade we had to run a timed mile and I ran a 6:50 mile as a 10 year old. In 6th grade I dropped out of soccer because of an extremely rigorous coach. I then didn’t join any sports for about 5 years, then I did tennis for freshman year. Unfortunately it was cut short due to covid, and school shut down. I stuck at home for about 6 months. School recently started online and I made it a goal to become fit before school started in person in the spring. Keep in mind I’ve never worked out before in my life so it was quite hard to begin. I would bench one day, and run a mile another. And took a break on Sundays.

2980,2980,2980,65,Any idea what's going on with my feet? Pain and swelling. Now it's gone.,1599619080,"I started running at 19. I'm in my mid thirties now. From 19 to 22 I ran in standard running shoes. I was doing around four miles five days a week. 

I started running in vibram five fingers shoes at 22. I ran anywhere from 5 to 8 miles five or six days a week till my late twenties. 

I've always run on pavement. I've always just went out and ran. Never timed myself or had a workout plan. 

Up until my late twenties I never had any feet problems or pain. I felt great. I felt like I could run forever.

I work a job where I'm on my feet all day long. I've done this since I graduated college at 22. Four months a year (summer) is my busy season and I'm super busy. I'm working 10, 12, 14 hours a day running around my shop. I don't sit down at all.

In my late twenties my feet just hurt and swelled up. I stopped running during my busy season for a few years because the pain was unbearable. It got to the point where I had to cut my mileage down significantly even during my slow work season and then I just stopped running. I haven't run for about three years. I do other forms of cardio and lift weights.

My feet still hurt and swelled up during my two previous busy seasons even during my three years of not running. It wasn't nearly as bad as when I was running but it was still a problem. I got insoles, properly fitted work shoes, and it helped a bit. 

So this year we have COVID and my work week went from five days a week to six or seven and my daily hours at work went way up. I probably worked 30 or 40 percent more hours a week compared to my previous years. My busy four month season just ended. The foot pain I expected to experience this season didn't happen. I actually went from wearing standard work shoes with insoles to barefoot running shoes a month in and my feet feel great. No foot pain and no swelling. 

I'm really at a loss. I am tempted to start running again. The only thing I can think of that changed was for the past four or five years I was super obsessed with hydration. I think I went overboard with it. Right before the start of my busy season this year I stopped doing that.

2989,2989,2989,75,First in person race on Labor Day since covid reminded me why I do this...,1599613538,"Random observation and personal zen moment I thought I'd take the time to put into words.  

So I've been running for a little over 4 years now starting as with most people, the Couch to 5K.   In that time I've run 5000+ miles since that first 0.89 'run' in 2016 and burned a little over a million calories (random personal trivia).   

Training miles, slogging miles out regardless of heat, cold, wind, rain and snow, I don't enjoy them, I don't get a runner's high, I don't feel great running at the start, middle or end, most runs are painful in some way.  To say I'm not built for running is an understatement of biblical proportions. 

I take some small satisfaction in the sense of accomplishment but no enjoyment in the struggle to get better, to go longer. 

But...

For obvious reasons I haven't run a race in 7 months.   But yesterday on U.S. Labor Day we had a small trail race locally, in person.  A 5 mile and a 2 mile combined on a local trail system that has a wide range of surfaces and verticality. 

And that long gap of no racing really dialed in 'why' I run.  As i was sitting on top of my SUV keeping an eye out for a parking spot for my running partner I had a sense of elation and anticipation I haven't felt in... 7 months.  Watching runners show up, men, women, children, obvious elites and obvious people for whom this might very well be the start of their couch to 5k program.   And I realized this is why I run.  The gathering of like minded individuals, 'my tribe' if you will.  

For the record, I'm not fast, I rarely place in my age group mostly because there's a bunch of ringers in my age group or so I tell myself.  So 'winning' a race has no meaning for me which takes a lot of the pressure off I think.  No, a race for me at best is a race with the people immediately ahead of me but mostly with myself. 

When we lined up (in waves based on estimated pacing, properly distanced from each other) we all had the same goal, to finish that course in as short a time as possible for each of us.   Whatever that time ended up being.  For the curious a 12 year old took first overall with an average pacing of just over 6 minutes for 5 miles over some pretty technical sections.   The kid is... talented. 

And over the next 50 something minutes for me, every step, including one fall, was so much fun, so much sheer enjoyment, unlike the 1000's of miles I've put in to train, that it was a giant light bulb going off.  

The race is why I do it, especially trail races but road races too.  The race is why I throw good money away to get a cheap t-shirt that gets thrown in a box and cheaper mass produced participation medal to run courses that for the part I could run any time for free.   The race is what I look forward to in this sport/activity/personal masochism we call running. 

I know everyone who runs, runs for all the reasons, someones multiple reasons at once, fitness, stress relief, to eat all the things, socially, competitively, to get out of the house, the list is literally endless.

I've been running for 14 years since I was a freshman in high school. Any seasoned runner will know how much will have changed by now, but on top of all the physical changes I also recovered from a fractured ankle four years ago.

I have a plate and seven screws on my ankle bone but by now I can still run as vigorously as I used to. I'd just like to get some insight on what to look for when buying new shoes. I have a pair of ASICS Men's GEL Venture 5 that I may be putting out of commission for something better - both ankles have been feeling somewhat sore from running on them this past year.

What should I look for when buying the best next pair of shoes? I recently came across a shoe fitting guide that recommended I bought shoes for Stability (mid-height), but I'm also thinking I may need to look for good ankle support... Or maybe not?

Hoping I can hear from anyone who's recovered from an ankle fracture before, but any insight will be greatly appreciated.

3013,3013,3013,1,Anterior tibialis muscle hernia?,1599600741,"Hello,

Some time ago I was searching symptoms that I had been personally experiencing and came across this five-year-old thread that seemed to hit the nail on the head:

[Former Reddit thread regarding anterior tibialis muscle hernia](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/3apjjj/anyone_else_have_a_lower_leg_hernia_muscle_hernia/?)

I have a two similarly-sized (in relation to the previous thread that was linked) lumps located on the outer shin muscle of my right leg. Both, when pressed, have nothing underneath - it feels as if I am sticking my finger into a hole in my outer shin muscle.

As a middle schooler I could run endlessly and effortlessly as my father had been a track coach / runner his entire life and started me early on (my first 5K at the age of 5). But when I approached 8th grade I stopped running and found myself more interested in (web) design - what followed was a year of sitting in front of the computer whenever I had free time, and a lack of physical activity such as running. After a year had passed, my father had me join one of the track practices that he was coaching and for the first time in my life I struggled tremendously. The shin splints were terrible and painful and I was never able to ‘run out of them over time’ as most people seem to be capable of.

Eventually the soft lumps formed and I noticed that whenever I ran it would feel as if someone was stabbing my leg with a knife, particularly in that area where the lumps are. And no matter how many times I mentioned this to my father, he seemed to think I could run out of it - but I felt I knew my body better and that this problem wouldn’t be fixing itself on its own. With practice, I was able to build myself up to 5-7 mile runs, but often times my leg would go completely numb - I assumed blood flow issues due to the lump (just an assumption, however). And while I do play soccer (or football, if you are reading this from elsewhere), I have to do a few minutes of warm up jogging before playing otherwise my legs will instantly numb - it also becomes difficult to flex my foot upward because of the pain. I’ve never been able to finish an entire soccer match once these lumps presented themselves.

I will say that I wonder if part of the problem is that the muscles surrounding my ankle might be weak - and perhaps my foot ‘sags downwards’ (for lack of better words) whenever I pick it up to make the next step in my run, thus stepping onto it beginning on the outer side of my front toes and then letting the rest of the foot touch down afterwards. If I try to keep my foot firm and run heel (or mid foot) to toe, the lump area becomes excruciatingly painful. 

I suppose my question is if anyone here has had this particular issue and had it successfully treated to a point where the pain is no longer there? I’d love to be running 5K’s, 10K’s, and marathons one day in the future if possible - I know that with my fitness and love for physical activity I can, but with my leg problem I 100% am out of the races.

It would be nothing short of a miracle and would make me happier than the world if I could get this fixed - but I’m wondering if there really are any procedures that anyone has gone through and could recommend (I’ve noticed a few in my research on Google with the same search term as the title of this post, and I know that I will need to see a doctor, but would like to get some reviews of experiences here first if at all possible).

Thank you!

3024,3024,3024,12,I played the role of Race Director yesterday...,1599592384,"...and for as small as it was, about 12-13 of us total, it was a success!

First off, mods, I apologize if this is against rules.  If it is, then I respectfully submit myself to do as you must.

Secondly, story time!   Prior to quarantine, a bunch of my cousins and some of our friends had been getting more into fitness, specifically running.  They were all looking forward to doing events that were coming up this year, but we all know what happened here.  Anyways,  when virtual race events became a thing a few months back, they looked to me (as out of our group, I had a bit more experience with running and running events) to set something up.  We ended up finding one of IRun4Movement's themes that we all thought was a fun theme and went with it.  We picked Labor Day weekend as it was a 3-day weekend and at that point, it was enough time for people to train for a 10k.  

Where most of the group lived was a flat area and most of their running was done just around their neighborhoods and local parks, so I picked a route that was a bit more scenic and had a bit more action, the Johnny Cash Trail.  This was a route my girlfriend and I had run before.  I thought it was perfect as it was a 10k that starts and ends at the same spot, there was a good change of pace as far as terrain, and it was a route with nice views that the group would not have seen otherwise.  

I set up a meeting spot and made a map of the parking location in relation to where the run would begin.  I mocked up a map of the run and did my best to describe the route as best as I could.  I set up a time for us to meet and what time we would be starting at.  I tried to give the best tips I know of what to expect on the run, how to prepare for the run, what to bring on the run, the etiquette of running on the trail, how to prepare for the hot weather (I picked an early start time because of this) etc.  I wanted to give them as much information as I could so we could all have a successful run.  For the most part, they were all running this for completion, not time, but for the ones that wanted to do it for time, I made sure to remind them to become familiar with the route.  

When yesterday came around and we were all at the meeting spot, I made sure to give reminders on all the route and all the things I pointed out.  When we started the race, I purposefully pulled ahead so I could get to parts of the route where people might get confused on where to turn.  It's a pretty straight forward route, but there are parts where you could make a wrong turn.  For the ones that fell too far behind, I sent them pictures of the checkpoints with an arrow or my hand pointing which way to go.  I had packed my hydration vest with 50/50 water gatorade mix in case anyone needed it, but luckily most everyone came prepared.  At each checkpoint, I pointed where they would go with some loud cheering to egg them on.  At the finish, my cousin's wife was there to cheer the finishers and to present them the medals.  

I know it was only a 10k, but to some of them, this was a big accomplishment.  This was the longest run they've had.  I wanted this to somewhat resemble a race day for those that haven't experience a race day yet.  In the end, everyone finished and everyone had a lot of fun doing it.  If I was to do it again, I want to come to the trail the day before and set up markers to help make it easier for those who pulled ahead to know where they're going.

Prior to yesterday I had run a 1:50:50 half marathon as a part of my training for a full marathon. That was in the spring time, and had totally kicked my butt when I did it. This summer I ended up having to temporarily relocate from the northeast to Phoenix, AZ, which really put a damper on my training. I wasn’t used to the scalding temperatures and only went on a few runs over 10 miles. I just got back to the northeast last week, and have been running 4-8 miles per day with a bit of cross training here or there to ease back into my marathon training plan. Thus, yesterday I was planning to just run 4-6 miles at an easy pace.

And I just kept feeling great the longer I went! I ended up PRing in the 10 mile (dropping from a 1:20:06 to a 1:14:55) and figured it would be a piece of cake to PR in the half marathon, too. I ended up crossing the metaphorical line at a 1:38:57, almost exactly 12 minutes faster than my previous best. I’m not sure how I got so much faster, given that I couldn’t train as much as I would have liked over the summer, but I sure am excited about it! I’m feeling much more confident about my impending full marathon that’s planned for November. 

Has anyone else seen this type of improvement recently? Maybe as a result of more time to train during quarantine?

She was supportive, encouraging and kind throughout however.

I barely keep up my mileage and average 15 miles from April - August. I wasn’t feeling it, probably like thousands of other runners out there.

Well along comes September and I get a ‘CatmanLee’ can I go out running with you from Miss CatmanLee, I was shocked and was happy to go out for a little run. Miss CatmanLee was adamant that we go for a mile run, no more and no less...and that’s exactly what we did in 11:56 minutes and once again today in 11:37 minutes. She has sadly got very disheartened at the fact that she is super unfit (her words) and that she’s really tired at the end. - I’ll just add that she hasn’t ran a mile in four years. I explained to her that it’s a really good time, many people would be happy with that, especially starting from scratch but she compares it to myself who barely had a sweat.

I’m no Mo Farah and averaged 9:45 minute miles on my longer runs earlier in the year (16+), but still felt deflated after explaining her time is really good.

Have you guys got any ideas? I love that she’s trying, interested and trying to become a bit fitter, but I don’t want her to fall at the first hurdle. Here’s what I’ve done so far...

▫️ Recommended C25k
▫️ Encouraged her that a 11:37 mile is nothing to be annoyed about
▫️ Advised Rome wasn’t build in one day
▫️ Told her to run slower and walk (pretty much C25k however)
▫️ Planned long brisk walks with her to up cardio - 20k steps +

So I am a 29 year old male. I started running in early 2017. I run pretty consistently. I run about 3-4 times a week at about 3-4 miles per run. 

Since the pandemic started in March, I have been in a funk. I have not been as motivated to run as I used to be. I may run only once a week now. 

A few months ago I injured my Achilles tendonitis and had to wait for that to heal. Also my feet have been bothering me. On top of that, I may have a case of runners knee. 

Internally I believe I suffer from IBS. It has affected my runs but usually it’s not too bad. The last few months when I run, I get horrible cramps on the last mile of my run. I literally have to slow way down to make it bearable. I’m thinking it maybe nutrition related or the fact that I live in Georgia where it is hot all the time. I may not drink enough water either. 

I used to run a 5K in 22-23 minutes but lately I have been running them in 28 minutes which is horrendously slow and embarrassing. This gets me even more down than I am already am and causes me to not want to run.

Here's the Clif's Notes version:

Booneville Backroads Ultra - 100 Mile (Covid) Edition  (http://boonevillebackroadsultra.com/)
102.5 miles - 28hrs 10min  5th male, only 9 finished, out of 24 starters (7 men, 2 women).

Weather started out cool, but the temps hit the low 90's by afternoon and stayed there until about 6:00 PM with no clouds and little wind.  Stayed in the upper 70's through the finish.

I hit a few low points; most notably at ~50 miles and ~80 miles, but managed to work through it. I became intimately in tune with the complete mental screw game a race of this distance turns into later in the game.  I had an idea of what it would be like from training, but the magnitude of it was intense.

All said though, I felt pretty positive the whole time.  In fact, on the first and second 50k loops I was singing along with my music, and on the last leg I was telling delirium fueled dad jokes to my pacers (much to their amusement).

I am friends/acquaintances with a few of the runners, whom are much better runners than me, that DNF'd, and I am in shock that I managed to finish where a few of them didn't.  That sounds like I'm casting shade at them, but I think my relatively slower pace at the start saved me versus some of their faster starts once the heat turned up.

Lastly, by the last 20ish miles walking and running hurt about the same, so I tried to run as much as possible at the end.  It went better than I expected.

The last aid station had Mountain Dew pancakes, which were freaking amazing.  Mana from the running gods.  

Anyway, I had a blast!  I worked my ass off to get to this point in my running life.  I had a ton of support from my family and friends.  I can't begin to express the level of gratitude I have for them helping and even encouraging my insanity.

3054,3054,3054,42,Stockholm Half Marathon Virtual Edition,1599573099,"### Race information
* **What?** Ramboll Stockholm Halvmarathon Virtual Edition
* **When?** September 5, 2020
* **How far?** 13,1 miles
* **Finish time** 2:40


### Background
I (50M, 94kg, 178cm), decided to run the race about 10 months ago, a few months after I took up running.
Earlier in my life there has been close to none exercise in any form. Been more into cooking, baking and champagne.
The first months of training was tough for my body. Aching and I overtrained and hurt my knee, resulting in one month recovery wo running. 
Still I'm lucky to always long for my next run. Maybe because I can do something new and challenging I never thought was possible.
Also my suprised children, used to their foodie-dad, helped my motivation a lot.
I followed Hal Higdon's Half Marathon Novice 2 program. Did a lot of the training at my country house in the summer where it was hot, humid and hilly. Soon the longer distances felt fine.
I think the program was a little too short, next time I will do more long runs, as I really feel they improve me as a runner. Perhaps Matt Fitzgerald's, also with more speedwork.
My son was supposed to join me, but things got in his way, so my son in law took his place, with short notice (in the morning of the race day, talking about time to prepare...). He's quite athletic but never done so much running.
The night before the race my mother told me that my brother only have a couple of months left to live. In many ways I think that running is emotional and this would of course affect the race.

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |&lt; 2.30 | *No* |
| B |&lt; 2.45 | *Yes* |
| C |Finish | *Yes* |

### Pre-race
Did nothing special, tried to drink extra the day before but my stomach didn't like that. So only a couple of toasts and a coffe in the morning.

### Race
The race was virtual so we ran close to where I live, in the centre of Stockholm. A very flat trail by the water.
I don't like to eat anything during my runs, so I drank powerade instead.
First 12k was fine and my plan was to have a negative split. However when the time came to speed up I noticed that that was not going to happen. Instead I would be glad to maintain my current pace.
My son in law started to get pain in his legs, but all my bodyparts was cooperating very well. Stamina-wise it was the opposite. The last 4 km was very painful, lost the tempo completely, never felt so exhausted and dizzy before.

### Post-race
Friends and my children was waiting at the finish line and I was very happy but completely bonked.
Afterwards we had a big dinner with a lot of discussions and wine.
I'm a little bit worried that I dragged my son in this. Will feel guilty if he gets any injuries.


### What's next?
Next I will start a 5k program and my plan is to do a HM-training plan with more volume. I think there is a lot room for improvement.

3062,3062,3062,50,Trying to get an anaerobic running workout with hill repeats (and failing),1599563165,"My Garmin forerunner 945 has a funky little chart thing that shows the balance of low aerobic, high aerobic, and anaerobic exercise.   
I've been consistently above optimal on high aerobic, okay on anaerobic, and too short on low aerobic, so I've tried to increase the number of runs in the low aerobic heart zone, which has meant that low aerobic and high aerobic are a much better balance, but the anaerobic is now falling short.   


In an attempt to remedy this, I thought I'd try 10x60 second hill repeats this morning, with a 5 minute warm up before and a five minute cool down after, but overall the training effect finished up 4.1 aerobic and 1.5 anaerobic. I was hoping for this to be much more biased away from aerobic and towards anaerobic. 

Generally, I was covering about 220 metres in an uphill repeat over 60 seconds, then jogging back down to the bottom of the hill to repeat the next repeat. I was finishing each repeat in the low end of zone 5 (max) and starting each repeat at the high end of zone 3 (high aerobic). 

Basically, what can I do to shift the emphasis of the hill repeats towards anaerobic?

I run 3 days a week for about 45 minutes each session - Monday - running, Tuesday - break and so forth.

I’m a runner and personal trainer, and with gyms opening back up I wanted to share a workout routine for anyone who was interested. 

This workout is great for sprinters and fast mid distance runners, but could help anyone gain some lower body strength. 

Superset (3 sets)
Deadlift: Heavy weight, 3-6 reps
Power Clean: Mid weight, 6-10 reps

Superset (3 sets)
Pause Squat: Mid weight, 8-12 reps
Split Squat: Mid weight, 8-12 reps each leg

Superset (3 sets)
Box Jumps, 10-12 reps
Single Leg Box Jumps*, 6-10 reps each leg
Single Leg Squats*, 6-10 reps each leg

*Only do the single leg exercises if you feel comfortable doing so. If you are new to strength training you’ll want to work up to doing these. 

These exercises will help build strength, especially in the posterior chain, which helps your initial push out of the gate. It also works on explosive power and stamina, which help give an extra kick for sprints. 

Make sure you warm up and cool down properly! Let me know if you have any questions.

I'm a newer runner. I started jogging 3-4 times a week about 4 months ago and am now 4-5 days a week for 3-5 miles at a time. I always run on trails, though usually well-maintained park trails. This last week I went for a 3.5 mi trail run on rougher terrain and one long run (4 mi) on pavement. The pavement run murdered my feet. I broke two metatarsal bones in February and could actually feel the area around the old break complaining, so I cut the run short and walked home.

Since then, my calf muscles have just been pissed off at me. I've had to run shorter distances, and I could barely make it through 3 rounds of 1 mile intervals today. It seems to be the lower part of my calf. I do stretches after my run about half the time, and I also self-massage after every run. I take magnesium to help with cramping too. I took Sunday off, but I'm just not sure if I should try to run through it, doing shorter intervals if I have to, or if I should completely rest for a few days.

3110,3110,3110,0,Some tips from a newbie that may help you not to lose interest in running,1599517340,"Hey. If you are feeling discouraged or not willing to put on your shoes to go outside often any more, some things I have found that helped me a lot:

1) I always listen to an audiobook while running. This is the main thing that keeps me running for sure. Without it, I would get so bored listening to the rhythm of my feet hitting the ground or whatever.

Time passes so fast on a run when I'm engrossed in a book. While listening, suddenly 5km flies by. Most like listening to music on a run, and I do too, but that does not get me excited to make the effort to decide to run, because I listen to music all day at home or at work. 

If you don't want to listen to an audiobook, go for music or perhaps an app you can learn a language with. I would not enjoy running at all if I could not listen to something. Just stay safe with regards to cars and the road of course.

2) Download an app on your phone like Strava that tracks your runs. It's quite a fun game to see how you progress, and partly get you ashamed of a lull in activity by you if you see your friends constantly posting, lol. (My brother has run like 10km every day for 3 years, you're crazy...)

3) But seriously, do not worry about how fast people around you run, or how often. Just focus on yourself. You don't even have to aim to get better, just aim to keep healthy.

4) If you're feeling hurt or out of breath, just walk or stop (ideally at somewhere pretty!). There is no shame in it at all. Don't hurt yourself and make yourself dread running because you know it hurts.

In the same vein, take rest days constantly. I was running every day for a while early on and hurt my knee because of it. I highly recommend at least 1 rest day in between runs.

5) Everyone knows to buy good running shoes, but also get good running socks. I got some Injinji toesocks, where it's individual fabric for each toe. Annoying to put on (legit takes over 2 minutes lol), but stopped me getting blisters that would discourage me from running more. 

Hopefully this helps.

I've been running regularly for a around two months, 3 times a week and just completing the Couch to 5K app program. I felt this was the best way as I was 315lb when I started working on my nutrition back in February, and now with combined effort from running I'm at 260lb.

I currently run on tarmac, and will be for the foreseeable. I'm wearing good fitting Nike Metcon 5' but they are very much a all-round gym/cross fit shoe and do very little to stop impact travel (as my foot goes down I can feel the vibrations traveling up my front shin). 

I am booked into a local store next week to get my gait recorded and my foot structure analysed to see what the best type of shoe will be for me.

Hello fellow runners,

I have been a road runner since long and have started trail running off late. I am yet to buy a trail running shoe. For road running, I use the Asics Gel Kayano 23 (may need an upgrade). Now, as I am new to trail running, I have been looking for some shoes online and my friend recommended Altra Timp 2.0.

I had Skechers Go Meb Speed 4 a couple of years back and they were also too tight around mid sole and were very uncomfortable for me. So, don’t want to fall into that trap again.

\### Training

I had been trying to run a few times a week since I got my new running watch for Christmas. It was getting a little rough right before we went into lockdown in March, I just didn't have the time to fit in runs with my job (teacher) and my kids. (Especially after track season started, because my partner coaches, leaving me to handle all after school activities until he got home.) But after we went into lockdown, I started getting very consistent in my running schedule. I ended up taking most of May off due to an injury, and then the summer was sort of sporadic what with vacations and the oppressive summer heat. For the past month I upped my weekly mileage and my pace, knowing that I was going to get to run in an actual race Labor Day weekend. My training was solely roads, though. The last time I trail ran was in March.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The USNWC decided to open the course at 7 AM and close it at 3 PM. We were able to enter and run at any time. The starting line wasn't as crowded as it usually is, but there were quite a few people milling about. There were people there cheering runners as they crossed the finish line, and with the music playing it had the same feeling as a regular race. I wore my mask up until I crossed the start line, because safety first. When my partner looked at me and said, ""Are you ready? Let's go,"" I actually teared up a little bit. We missed about four of our usual Spring and Summer races, and every time we'd hear that one was cancelled it felt like we may never actually run in a race again. It just felt so good to be back in that pre-race atmosphere again that I almost didn't want to leave to start the race.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Since it was the first time I'd been on a train in months, I wasn't planning on breaking any records. I wanted to run strong, and I told myself that I shouldn't be longer than 40 minutes. One of the first things I realized was that I missed the toe spread I have in my road shoes, Altra Escalante Racers. I wear Merrell Trail Gloves for trail, and suddenly I felt like they really too tight and glove-like. I'm definitely going to try a pair of Altra trail shoes before the next trail race.

I had never run a trail racer with a staggered start, and it was glorious. There was no bottlenecking on the trail, which was good because this course was on a very narrow trail. Most places required you to get off the trail to let someone pass, which is always a struggle when you start in a large group. There were people running on the trail, I was passed a few times and I passed some people. Early on I realized that everyone who passed me was giving me some encouragement as they ran by. This was the first race for most of us since quarantine, and you could really feel the community. I made sure to say something positive to the people I passed, just wanting to pass on the good feeling. That was what the race was about to me, just feeling good about being out running with others.

After I saw my second split, I decided I was going to have to reassess my goal of 40 minutes. I was going MUCH slower on the trail than I had anticipated. I think several things contributed to me being slow: first time on a trail since March; a very narrow, tight, and tree root-y trail; and not having my usual landmarks to pace off. I told myself that I could be happy with 45 minutes, as long as I finished strong. I knew the last bit towards the finish line is a hill, and after I left the woods I reminded myself I had trained for this by running up a much steeper hill in my neighborhood at the end of my runs, so there were no excuses. I glanced at my watch as I got closer and saw it was under 40. I knew I couldn't clear the hill in one minute, but I was going to be close. I crossed the finish line feeling good about myself, which is not how I usually cross the finish line.

\### Post-race

I got water and waited for my partner. This was the first race we've ever run where I've beat him. I don't feel particularly proud of that because he hasn't been training at all, but he never really does any sort of training and he still always beats me. I think it boils down to stride length, so even if I'm in better shape I can't outrun him.

We hung out and watched some of Team USA canoe and kayak on their training runs on the whitewater, then we had a beer. We went to lunch at a brewery, and then home for a nap. 

I was hoping to run today, but I woke up with very stiff and wonky knees. It's probably a result of trail running and the fact I missed a week with my RA medicine. So I'll be back out tomorrow morning, early, before my first day of virtual teaching. I have a feeling teaching virtually is going to mean my weekly mileage dramatically increases, because I just can't sit in front of a computer for very long without losing my mind. 

Cheers to everyone who ran this weekend!

I did this, and it took me a month (after it got down to a 30 second break I decided it was pointless to take the break). Today I ran the full 5k, and it was 1,000,000 times easier. I seriously wish I would have done this when I started running.

### Training
Male, 29 years old. 

Over the last 8 years I've been a casual runner, emphasis on the casual, not more than 3 a week and stopping for months or years at a time. 1 marathon and two 1/2 marathons.  After reaching peak weight in February (work trip to US did not help) of 115kg at 6'1 I was struggling to run 5k in 35 minutes. When lock-down started I took it as a great opportunity to create a solid routine and have dropped to 96.6kg as of yesterday, mostly through CICO. I wanted to increase my runs per week but, going all out most runs, I found it really hard to run more than 2 days in a row. I stumbled across low-HR training and really liked the idea of slowly down, enjoying the runs, and still supposedly seeing the benefits. I was convinced mostly by a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MALsI0mJ09I) by Stephen Seiler on the benefits of training mostly low intensity. I was also helped out a lot on this subreddit, so thank you to the many redditors who answered my questions!

I based my training mostly off MAF (180-age is your target max HR during a run), 151bpm for me. I know it's not massively scientific but runs felt great at that HR, even if I was slowing to a walk for the first few weeks. It felt like I was solidly in my aerobic zone. The idea is as your aerobic fitness improves you will be able to increase your pace whilst keeping a low HR, and be less susceptible to injury and fatigue not going all out. It was a bit of an epiphany for me that running slower can make you fitter, but thought it was worth a short.

For reference when running regularly last year I would call 5:45min/km a high intensity pace I could only keep up for 5km.  Over the next 12 weeks I built up my distances not worrying to much about pace, and by week 5 I started to see a great improvement in pace at the same HR. I began at around 7min/km 12 weeks ago and by last week was at 5:59/km average. It was so satisfying finding I could run faster without feeling like i'd done much more work. I know I've been very lucky in that many people find this training takes 6 months minimum, I saw good results in 3. Being cynical you could probably argue the fact I was increasing my mileage was having a much bigger impact on my pace than low-HR training, but if nothing else running slowly meant I could go from 50km a month to 210km whilst feeling not much fatigue. 

I ran every run 'easy pace'/under 151bpm (occasionally over) for 12 weeks. 5 days a week, building up to 55km a week. I didn't introduce any speed work, though I will in the next few weeks. My longest training run was 17km. 

Overall I didn't plan nearly as much as I should have for a 1/2 marathon race, but I knew I had the mileage down and I wanted to test out the low-HR training results for the last 3 months. As I was doing this solo I wasn't so worried if I had to bail out with tiredness, so that helped me push and not hold back. 

My prior PB for half marathon was 2:11, 2018, Greater Manchester Marathon. Training for that was 2 hard runs a week, and a long easy run. Not enough knowledge or understanding of training principles at all. 


### Pre-race
Went for a nice walk at lunch, had a small dinner at 17:30 and starting running at 20:30! Wife's birthday dinner the night before acted as carb load. 

### Race
KM 1-5
After 12 weeks running with my eyes fixed on my HR monitor it felt amazing to forget all that and just run. I had missed it and I had to stop myself from going too quickly! I tried to hit 5:42min/km to hit a 2 hour finish time. Felt comfortable and happy. 

KM 6-14
Feeling great and endorphins rushing to the head I decided to pick up the pace a bit, and took it below 5:15min/km. Not my best idea, and I paid for it later in the race. I'm terrible at pacing myself, and it's even harder without a pacemaker. Felt good up until km 12 though, before starting to lag. 

KM 15-20
Shortly before KM 15 I had a horrible realisation it was nearly 10pm on a Sunday, I had forgotten to bring any water and had forgotten a mask to enter a shop. As soon as I realised that, of course I started to feel dehydrated and headache appeared. I remembered a public water fountain about 2.5km away and rerouted to head there. 

It was during this period that I hit the wall twice, getting a bad stitch and having to slow down to nearly walking pace. An old shoulder injury also appeared for good measure and I grunted and squealed my way through residential streets at 10pm at night. I can't imagine how it sounded to anyone with the window open... This close to finishing and on track for a PB it would have taken my leg to fall off for me to stop and I managed to keep going. 

KM 20
Hitting the last mile is always magical in a long distance race, the pain fell away and I managed the last mile as close to a sprint as I could get to, reaching 4:25min/km in KM 20! I crossed the line and kept going for 200m just to make sure Strava would register the half marathon distance. 


### Post-race
Felt super happy, not only did I hit sub-2 hour 1/2 marathon but I got a 10km PB to boot at 55 minutes! Best of all I felt I had I had another 3-4 minutes in me, and will definitely be attempting a 10km PB attempt next week, aiming for 50 minutes. 

I can't stress enough how satisfied I've been with the low-HR training, it enabled me to run longer, enjoy my runs, stay injury free, and see a dramatic increase in my endurance. I know it's nothing revolutionary but I feel a lot of casual runners like me assumed that if you want to get faster you need to exclusively be pushing yourself as hard as you can. No Pain No Gain and all that (yes I watched the Stephen Seiler TED talk, you should too). This has completely reserved that mentality for me. I know I will need to introduce speed work to keep improving, but I couldn't be happier and more into my running as I am now.

No set time, (ppl in different area codes) and I don’t want anyone to hesitate due to experience level or fear of not finishing with everyone. 3. I plan to make a big and mail it out to everyone who is interested and when they finish they send a selfie of completion.

My goal is to just bring everyone together during these crazy covid times though physical health and incorporating my true love, running!

Full disclosure: I am not, nor have I ever been, a runner.

And yet here I am, having agreed to run 75km over the month of October for charity. 

I won’t go into details but a former classmate of mine sadly committed suicide over lockdown, so I, along with a number of friends, have decided to raise some money for a mental health/suicide prevention charity. I’ve agreed to run 75km over the month of October to represent the fact that 75% of suicide cases in the UK are men.

Ideally I’d like to do 2.5k every day or 5k every other day, or a mix of both, having taken the time between now and the start of the month to train.

Which is all well and good but I have no idea where to even begin :)

I used to run religiously from about 2k14 - 2k16. During this time, I ran pretty much solely (hehe) in Nike Frees. I was never a long-distance runner and mainly focused on my goal which was to run a 12 minute 3km. I achieved that goal and pretty much lost interest in running as a hobby because I had other cardio-intensive sports. Anyway, I recently decided that I was going to get back into running so I bought a pair of Brooks GTS 18's last year. I've done some running in them, and I just struggle. My legs ache, and I really slow. I think this is mostly due to the fact that they somewhat inhibit my ability to run on my toes - as I'm not a mid-striker. Do you guys think it's work going back to a minimalist shoe in order to get that performance back? Furthermore, do you think that the type of shoe you use really affects performance?

I'm not tall at all but I've seen that like my body goes lower down towards gravity especially when sprinting? I dunno if that made sense at all

well as soon as I heard that I could possibly have a weak core I immediately did some core excercises just to check it out (like some ab workouts) and most of the pain from the workouts hurt my lower back.

I'm wondering how can I tell if my core is weak? how can I I prove it to make it extremely strong? I also would like to know how much of an impact would it make for running and improving my 5k time? like does it matter a lot or does it provide some benefits but not a lot (this is not negating the importance of having a strong core I'm just curious on the impact it can have)

I’m mostly a lurker and rarely post on this sub. I’m a daily and 40-50 mile a week runner and have been for the past 7 years about. I live in the DC suburbs and running has been my biggest mental relief for the longest time and incredibly needed to make me feel stable and grounded. I have a pretty significant anxiety disorder and running helps that keep those feelings in check more so than any therapy, medication, or poor self medication like alcohol ever has. 



This morning on my run, I was running past my local strip mall (grocery store, CVS, bank etc) and the exit for the complex goes out into a one way right hand turn onto a major thoroughfare. An older Camry like car was in the exit and looking right into oncoming traffic and I swear the guy saw me and was letting me through on the sidewalk since I have the right away. As I was crossing, he lurched forward and hit me. Really it was nothing more than a nudge into my thigh area. 


I’m a pretty big guy. 6’ and a muscular 180lbs and there was no damage to me physically. Just a 5mph bump into my left thigh that spun me around. I was able to pause my Garmin in the moment without  falling or even drop my water bottle. 


The older man got out, I reassured him I was totally okay, and I continued on my 7 miler. However, I haven’t been able to shake the feeling of what could have been if it was god forbid a bigger vehicle or going faster,  but I’m totally fine. Not even a bruise 14 hours later.

Firstly, the race was supposed to be in May and got rescheduled to today. Along with rescheduling the race, the actual course and start time got moved as well. 

The race incorporated a 5k, half, and full marathon. In order to social distance the race was changed to the entire weekend, September 5-7. 5k and half marathon runners were to run Saturday or Monday, with marathoners running on Sunday. Each runner registered online for a start time. Runners could sign up from 5AM to 11AM, with five runners allowed to sign up in each five minute increment. If runners felt uncomfortable, they were allowed to sign up virtual and submit their time between August 1st and September 7th. 

Due to the race being changed to over 3 days, the course itself changed as well. This was due to the original race being on part of a public road, which they couldn’t shut down for 3 days. The course was changed to a local, beautiful running trail with a similar elevation change. 

Packet pick ups were offered over 5 days at different locations to promote social distancing. In order to avoid personal contact at the end of the race, finisher medals and t-shirts were provided during this time. 

Aid stations handed out full, sealed water and Gatorade bottles, along with gels. Runners were not allowed to stop at stations but needed to continue to walk to avoid crowding. 

Once finished, snack bags were provided for quick grab-and-go to get people in and out. Due to the different start times and virtual option, no placement awards were given. 

Overall, it was great to compete in an actual race again and this company did a great job with safety and social distancing. There is hope for all us runners for future races!",running,NerdHerdMember5,False,/r/running/comments/insrbc/today_i_ran_an_official_usatf_bq_certified/

I even did a 4 mile run the other day with absolutely zero effect on my mood, which was frustrating. But...here's the interesting part. Every time I've ever dealt with depression in one form or another, a pre-workout or stimulant, followed by a rigorous run or weightlifting routine almost always lifts me out of it and gives me that momentum to get work done and improve my mood throughout the day, and sometimes even the days following. Today I took 3/4 of a scoop of ON Gold Standard pre-workout (\~160mg caffeine) and some beta alanine right before I did a 5 mile run and had no problems at all, I felt GREAT.

3229,3229,3229,25,Help me decide - Running watch,1599419717,"Hello,

I know there are a thousand posts about which running watch to get. And i have read through quite a few, and even used DC rainmaker a few times to compare.

I know im not special nor am i the only one needing this specific watch, but maybe you all can recommend like a top 3 list?

The things i look for in a watch are 

1. GPS accuracy
2. 2. Battery life (with GPS on)
3. I want music storage if possible
4. only screens i check are active/current pace , total distance, total time (maybe current time)
5. The app on my phone (I have a pixel 4 XL) so Garmin Connect is good for me.
6. I would prefer some sort of smart watch features like answering texts or calls, but not a deal breaker

My current watch is the Garmin Forerunner 235. 

I feel like im due for an upgrade. I run almost every day, about 5miles average. I also enjoy running marathons and I want to run another Ultra in the near future. 

I do not care about elevation, maps, sleep tracker, etc. I basically only care how fast im going, how far im going, and how long im going. The watch needs to be compatible with android phones.

Am i over thinking it? I am looking at the 245 music, 645 music, and the 945.

I would prefer to keep it around the 300-500$ range though.

Week 9: 1.5km + 1km running with 300m walking in between
Week 10 (this week): 2km running 

So the first three weeks were suggestions from my PT then he basically told me to continue on my own and trust my body. I was looking at couch to 5 km program and it goes alot faster than what i did, i am in week 10 and still running 2 km only, did i go too easy on my program? 

Also another question, for context before injury my pr in 5km was 21 minute and 44 minute in 10km, 11:30 minute in 3 km. My easy run was between 5:00-6:00. I started running at 10/km then progressed to 9 then 8 and occasionally 7/km. If i reach 7/km, my hr goes high and i dont want to run too fast and get hurt. So how can i balance between improving my pace slowly and increasing my milage?",running,faisalaldoseri92,False,/r/running/comments/inoml2/running_after_an_injury/

I wanted to ask the community about their experience with patella tendonitis. I'm 32 years old and have been running pretty steadily for around 11 years. I cranked up my distances from around 2015 and have run several marathons and ultras, hitting pretty good times. With that said, the last couple of years I've felt like I'm having an increasing struggle to reach my pace and distance goals and all the while my knees have felt stiff and painful. I suspect patella tendonitis, though that self- diagnosis doesn't seem to have provided a framework for recovery. I try to maintain good stretching and strengthening exercises but that doesn't seem to make much of a difference. My knees remain stiff before and after runs and uncomfortable during runs. 

Since coronavirus hit my mileage dropped significantly for a number of reasons. I expected that this reduction might end up giving me time to recover, but in truth, my knees feel no better than when I was managing 100+km a week 6-12 months ago.

My question is, do you, or have you experienced chronic issues with your knees/patella tendons. If so, have you found anything particularly helps you? Or perhaps I am just experiencing ageing and this is what it feels like when you've already put a lot of miles on the clock. I'd prefer to think I still have some decent running in my future, but the discomfort is becoming an increasing mental barrier to my training.

Is there even a point in keeping a journal?

The other thing is it is so hard to find a journal with a good layout. I write my training plans on fill-in planners. This gives me a good view of my plan for every week, but not enough space for writing a race report or recording injuries etc, which is why I have a separate lined diary for that. You see my problem...

And even though I'm going the extra mile (lol) to do all this, I have never once read my running journal entries on paper. What then, is the point of keeping these things? Am I doing this wrong?

3287,3287,3287,85,Is this bad form? It feels right.,1599356278," 

To start with I am a fairly long-legged man. I am also very thin (5'10'', 135 lbs). I'm assuming that your proportions make a significant impact on optimal running form.

I've have been running some weeks now, to the point where I can maintain a fairly brisk pace, with a longer stride and a forefoot strike for my usual 6 mi run.

The thing that seems unusual, is that my arms tend to hang down near my hips, with around a 120 degree angle at the elbow. Like this, I swing them much less and instead there seems to be back-and-forth rotation of my shoulders generated by my core, it feels. Also I feel almost like I am leaning forward.

Running this way feels very natural at that pace. It kinda feels like I am swimming on land, actually. But this all seems contrary to what I read online about proper form. Most sources suggest keeping the arms higher, and generating the upper body motion at the shoulders themselves by moving the arms.

I found one forum post where people noted that japanese long distance runners keep their arms low. I am shaped not unlike a taller japanese male lol. Basically is this form correct? I would hate to strain myself this way, and I never see anyone else on the trail running like this.

3297,3297,3297,96,5km pace advice from experienced runners?,1599346000,"**Background**
M/45

I started running in April because my gym closed due to corona. I typically do long (for me) runs at low heart rate (120-135'ish, usually in the high 120's) a couple times a week, do shorter runs at medium heart rate (&lt;150) a couple times a week, and occasionally do a speed-focused workout, a couple times a month. No real plan, but it's difficult to stick to anything due to the horrendous heat and my odd-hours work schedule. I total 25-40km most weeks.

This summer has been absolutely horrific, with daily temperatures between 30-36 Celsius and humidity rarely dropping below 80%, often 90%+. So I've slowed down a lot, while at the same time I think my fitness is still improving.

I take runs as they come because I never know how I'll respond on the day, sometimes cutting distance in half, slowing down nearly to a crawl, etc.

But on the other hand, sometimes I'll just have a really great day and increase my pace a bit, as long as my heart rate doesn't go up too high.

About a week ago, it was 32 Celsius and 76% humidity, and I went out with the intention of doing a medium-pace 5km, keeping my heart rate around 145. After the first km, I felt so good I thought 'why not pick up the pace and go for a PR?', so I did, and I did.

* 1 - 5:30 (HR 145)
* 2 - 5:13 (HR 150)
* 3 - 5:06 (HR 159)
* 4 - 4:58 (HR 167)
* 5 - 4:42 (HR 175)
Total: 25:29 (5:06 avg)

**My question is**

Based on the above, and my fastest mile being about 7:06, plus I'm still fairly new so I've never actually tried to push into major discomfort, what sort of target pace might I shoot for if I decide to enter a 5km in the fall when the weather cools down?",running,amiarunnernow,False,/r/running/comments/inaqzf/5km_pace_advice_from_experienced_runners/

Depending on how hot out is is, about 5 minutes or so into (I've noticed that it's whenever I start to sweat), my chest, neck, back, and shoulders (also sometimes my head) start itching very annoyingly, and borderline painfully. Scratching doesn't help it, but after about 5ish more minutes of running/sweating, it goes away and I'm fine. It was really just annoying up until a few days ago when it, this may sound dramatic, it literally felt like a shit ton of tiny needles just poking into my skin and it actually hurt so bad and I could do nothing for it except endure it and try to not look like I'm having a seizure to all the cars driving past me.

3317,3317,3317,16,Update on the man who was stalking me during my evening runs,1599335726,"I posted a few days ago about a man who had followed me twice this week in his car while I was running at my local park. I run in the evenings lately, and this week was the first time I’d ever seen him or experienced something scary to that degree. 

He has been arrested. Yesterday I was running again. I went earlier in the evening and drove to the park instead of walked like I usually do. There were many people there because it’s the weekend. My father was also outside walking there. The man came speeding down the street, stopped in the middle of the street, started honking his horn, blew through stops signs, and was generally just driving erratically for about five minutes, then left. I called the sheriff and they found him in the next town over. They pursued him because he wouldn’t stop at first, but eventually did and was arrested on misdemeanor charges. He will likely be released in a couple days, but I’m glad something was done. My community is very fed up with this man. It seems like he’s been harassing many people here for a while, but no one really spoke up until I made my post on our community FB page.

Like I said in a comment on my original post, I s till going to run at this park and in the evenings. I’m going to drive there and go about half an hour earlier. But I’m not going to change locations because of this crap. I have multiple family members who live nearby, it’s half a mile from my home, many members of the community have reached out and offered video/picture evidence of him for my report with the sheriff, and they’ve also offered for me to go to their homes if I ever see him again and feel threatened. I’m surrounded by so many good people. I won’t let one bad person ruin it. I also still want to take self defense classes and look into getting a small weapon, such as taser, to take with me. Eventually as it gets cooler in the evenings, I will go earlier as well. 

I don’t mean this in a rude way, because there were many lovely people who commented on my post, but there were also many who were not supportive and who I felt gave me bad advice, like telling me to pick a different location to run in. Even when I explained this is the closest park for miles and I’d have to go another town where I don’t know the area or anyone near, I was still berated for saying I’m going to keep running at my park. I was downvoted for that and told self defense classes won’t really help me. 

I just don’t feel like this is the supportive community I thought it was. It’s a shame, because I live running, but I don’t feel welcome here, so this will probably be my last post. I just wanted to update the people who might be curious about what happened. I’m glad I stick to what I wanted. I’m glad I didn’t give up and run away and let some creep who doesn’t even live in this town scare me away from one of my favorite places.

I am overweight and have messed up feet from a history of dance and the weight gain. But my body is really good about endurance and building strength quickly so Ive made crazy progess.

Ive posted twice now on this subreddit trying to figure out what is happening to my feet. Ive been through Mizuno Inspires, Hoka Arahis, Saucony Guides... all different sizes and widths. All at some running shoe stores guidance. My feet did a number of weird things in each. Left usually turned sideways in the shoe and couldnt catch any weight on my big toe. Heels moved in both as my foot tried to counteract the so called support (had to stop every 100 yards or so to either kick my foot around or straight up relace my shoes or stuff something in the toe box). I basically had to walk if there was any incline or decline, because there was no way I could keep both feet in the shoe in a normal shape. I was losing my mind.

So today I went to Dicks just to find a very light, regular running shoe. I picked a few I thought looked lighter but supportive, and the girl asked before she went to find my size in the back if there were any others I wanted. I VERY randomly picked up a pair of lilac Nike Flex Experience 9s because I liked the color....


Tried the other shoes on, all the same. Toes felt weird, heels felt weird, felt like strapping a concrete block to my feet. Then I tried on the Nikes.

They are my normal shoe size, no ""extra room"" according to fitting size and common knowledge. But OH. MY. GOD. My feet are in the right place for the first time. The material is stretchy so my toes can move and find the ground. In a tapered toe box of a stability shoe that is a size up, my big toe slides up which then lets my foot roll in the shoe. This toe box is more squared so it cant roll. What Im getting at is these shoes are more supportive by far than any of the shoes Ive tried that are supposed to be that way.

Even though my posts have not been popular in the subreddit, I want to put my experience out there because I want other novice runners like me to know they arent crazy for ignoring what the running shoe experts are telling them. I know my opinion is not necessarily unique, but Im one of those people that likes to trust the ""expert opinion"" ""high tech"" hype out there. That outlook has made the last few months miserable. I found the exact right shoe for me, in a size no one would ever suggest, with no marketing for overpronation.

* 6ft1 and 145lbs
* 20yo male
* haven't ran in 2-3 years
* usually have some form of knee pain, I can never squat

If anyone has recommendations for a good shoes that:

* will work for the vast majority of completely new runners
* minimal chance of pain even for new runners with poor technique
* have decent cushioning, I remember getting shins splint back when I still ran
* generic enough, basically the first or second shoe you got that you thought was good enough before you specialized and went for pro shoes
* $80 - $120 US
* looks don't matter that much, just if possible not a shoe that looks like my grandma's trainers, but no big deal really

Foot dimensions:

* 9.5 - 10 cm wide across the ball of my foot
* 26.5 cm long from toe to heel
* 6 - 6.5 cm wide across heel

When I was growing up I was very active and played sports but in college my health got away from me in various ways. Its basically been 11 years of little to no activity and this past year when I hit 4 years sober I was ready to get my health back on track

So during my time in PT I have made major progress for myself. Only using a treadmill I've gone from only able to do 30 second intervals to 3 miles non stop at a constant pace. This past week I transitioned to outside running, I have been running indoors on a treadmill 4 days a week but this past week trying the same amount outdoors was very difficult for me. 

I'm having to do more intervals of walking and running outdoors since I am finding myself way more winded than on a treadmill, I know a treadmill assists a lot with moving my legs back so I'm looking for suggestions on improving training outdoors. A friend suggested i try running with a slight lean foward to keep foward momentum, when i described things to him he said it sounded like I was wasting energy and landing on my feet wrong. The watch I wear tracks some stuff during my runs and the main things it says need improvement are my contact time and vertical oscillation. So any suggestions on techniques or additional training I can do please let me know!

I’m 5’7 145lbs 27 y/o. 

I did sports throughout school; soccer, wrestling, football. Often I was the #1 fastest guy on any sports team in short distance - under 100meters. But I would pretty much always get smoked by anyone when it came to 1-3 miles. We had a dude named Cheeseburger - for good reason - on our wrestling team that would sometimes beat me in distance runs. Fat, skinny, tall, short. I’ve never been able to hang in distance.  


Since then, 18 y/o, I haven’t ran, but I do workout with weights hard and have some respectable maxes so I’m not a completely off the couch. 

I started couch to 5k 8 days ago and I suck, but I’m doing the program 2x a day - once morning once night. The program currently says 60 seconds run x 90 seconds walk repeat 8x. 

I run around my neighborhood in my cheap workout shoes which are Puma Trinomic. They look like running shoes to me? I tried a run in high top converse but that seemed to be a bad idea. 

My splits seem to be all over the place but mostly been 9:30’s. I’ll occasionally have 8:40’s. And occasionally have 10:10’s. I hit 7:50 today - remember these are only 60 second splits. 

I want to tackle some issues before I get too far into the program:

1) I pee before I run. But while I run I start to develop a constant need to pee. Is this just something you have to deal with? It’s really annoying. I had to make a pact with myself not to go back inside the urge is so strong. 

2) a few people have told me my calf’s/Achilles should not be sore or tight when I run. After my first 60 second split my calf’s/Achilles get pretty tight. After my second 60 second split, my calf’s/Achilles feel like they have a literal rod running through them. Incredible tightness. Is this just newbie pains? My shoes? Running form? I think I run pretty normal. My calf 

3) I have a Garmin Fenix 5x that says my VO2 max is 52. What does this mean exactly?

4) Whats up with my running shoes? I just want to be able to run whenever wherever. I don’t want to be *that guy* who can’t run because he doesn’t have his 300$ shoes, full workout outfit, Garmin watch etc. But if I need something better I could get some. 

5) couch to 5k’s warmup is a 5 minute walk. Is this enough? Again, I don’t want to be that guy who needs a 20 minute stretch, 5 minute walk, foam roll, and Pilates just to go on a run. 

6) since running I notice when I walk/run that when my foot strikes the ground, it doesn’t go straight heel toe. The outside of my foot touches the ground and “rolls” to the inside. It looks smooth and feels natural, but is that fine? 

7) is hitting the program 2x a day overdoing it? 

I’m going to complete this program no matter how bad it sucks, but I want to fix things before I’m 2 months in and develop bad habits. Any other tips are welcome.

3380,3380,3380,80,Looking for some advice transitioning back into running from long hikes,1599284254,"So about a month and a half ago I did the math and realized that, as a beginner runner who had a good 25 pounds to lose, I could burn more calories if I power walked on a hiking trail near my house instead. I can run for about a half hour before my body tells me it's quitting time, OR I can hike for about two hours before I reach the same level of fatigue. Based on the calculations, if I was willing to give up the extra time, I can basically burn double the calories.

Still, this was only ever meant to be a stopgap to strengthen up my injury-prone ankles and drop some weight before I start running for sport. I've just about maxed out how far I can walk on these things in two hours (6.47 miles in my last one, but I think I can make it to 7.5 before I'm maxed out on how fast I can walk), and I'm unwilling to give up MORE than two hours on these walks. I've already lost 8 pounds on this routine in the past month, so I think it's not far away from the time to start running again.

So I guess my question is, am I going to completely die if I try mixing in running laps on this long endurance hike? For reference, I use the same trail for running as well, and have proper trail running shoes, so that's not really the concern. I'm just wondering if mixing in running laps is going to kill me, since I'm hardly walking at a rest speed during my walking laps. Is it better to just jump right back into running once I've outgrown the power walks?

Or, should I just stay on these hikes for a while even once I can't really increase my distance anymore? I adore running, but my ankles tend to get injured a lot and they've always been my barrier to entry for running. So is it best to get the remainder of  the weight off so I can have less strain on my ankles and additionally give them a little more time to strengthen? (assuming that's a thing ankles do?)

So I got to the school track and after my first lap around I was unusually spent so I took a quick rest because I figured I went too hard. Hmm bad start.

After my second lap my feet began to hurt so I stopped to unlace and tie my shoes hoping it was the circulation bothering me. I sat around a bit. Ugh not my day

So after failing to even make it around running on my second lap, I headed to the start line to try again but then decided instead to walk in the direction of the bleachers. I sat and read a chapter of an ebook to get my mind off my poor performance. Ugh I suck.

I considered calling it quits after the short break on the bleachers but I just couldn't let myself end the run so terribly. I decided to make a trip to a local park in my area which also has a track. Maybe a change of scenery would help.

Oddly enough at a certain point walking to my destination I felt compelled to start my run before reaching the track. I ran to the park and then through the park path and then I made it to the track running and didn't stop! No pain. No desire to abort. No tiredness. Just thirst, which I eagerly quenched one mouthful at a time with my water bottle I was holding during my run around the track.

I ran like I borrowed Hermes shoes. I made it around 5 times before I decided not to overdo it and call it quits. Although I ran at a non impressive pace, it felt effortless compared to my other attempts at distance running. I don't know what got into me but I'm thinking those two failed laps around the track warmed me up and the break afterwards was all I needed for a fresh start.

I am on a conservation crew where I work eight 10-hour days followed by 6 days off. An average day's work includes anywhere from 3-15 miles per day of hiking with a heavy pack plus clearing downed trees with crosscut saws.

I'll be honest, I haven't ran in a month or two, but I did just come back from a two week hiking trip. Before that it was on and off running random distance of 2-5 miles 3 times a week. I took a third of a mile walk at halfway point, because I figured it would be a good idea.

I’ve really struggled with keeping up with my work outs while gyms have been closed, so I decided today that I want to run a half marathon. I know from previous experience that having something to train towards will help keep me honest about sticking to a routine.

I used to run a decent amount, and did 3 half marathons in 2016 (two of them were back to back weekends). But I took a long break at the end of that year, and didn’t pick up my running shoes again until this spring. 

I’ve sporadically done a few 5ks around my neighborhood, but my mileage is currently shit. Also some casual bike rides for an hour once a week or so. I’m out of shape but I’m not completely immobile.

I picked a date 12 weeks from now, but I noticed that the San Francisco Marathon is doing a virtual race 10 weeks. Paying money to do a thing, and having an official date that can’t be moved, would be really good motivators for me to keep on track. (Id also love to get a tshirt and medal for the effort).

3417,3417,3417,18,"""Slow Down"" is Overrated Advice",1599259084,"One of the most common things I see repeated in this Subreddit is the advice to ""Slow down"" - indeed, in certain scenarios I think this advice is well put.  But more often then not I see people advocating ""slowing down"" the pace of runs to other posters when they are missing any information which would indicate this is worth doing, and I think this comes from some foundational misunderstanding of WHY slowing down is ever good advice.

So when is slowing down the right thing to do, and why?  There are two scenarios where this makes sense

1. For people who are BRAND NEW to running, as in, still haven't completed a 2 mile run, have basically no idea what running is even supposed to feel like, ""slow down"" can be a useful cue to them, as unless you did XC or Track in school, you've likely gone your whole life either walking or sprinting, and it takes exploration to learn that there sub-maximal paces you're supposed to run at.
2. For people who are at the limit of the intensity stress they can manage at their current fitness and need to focus on quality workout days.  This ""slow down"" advice is good, because it maximizes the recovery effect the athlete gets on their easy, aerobic days, SO THAT THEY CAN PERFORM WELL ON THEIR WORKOUT DAYS.

What I see very often is people talking about low HR training when for all I can tell they run 25 miles a week, all at an easy pace.  Or posters advocating someone training for military fitness testing ""slow down"" their runs.  Or posters talking about walking up hills because their HRM goes out of whatever zone its supposed to be in when they attempt to run up them.  This is really wrong headed and it seems to be like nothing earns plaudits like telling someone to slow down without any real thought in whether or not that is actually good advice.

It makes little sense to me why this is repeated so frequently on this subreddit - that ""easy days should be easy"".  Yes, that tautology is illuminating, but this is a really ineffective foundation for a training plan.  Most people who run regularly do 0 workouts each week, they just do easy running - let me make this perfectly clear, if you don't do structured workouts, what the fuck are you running so ""easy"" for?   Doing this at low HR, true recovery pace has got to be *agonizing* and is flat out ineffective.  If you're going to run an unstructured plan (just ""base building"") go out and grind every now and then, pound out some miles hard.  You don't need to keep your HR at 125, what are you saving all that recovery for?  The rest day tomorrow?  Just go bang 'em out.

Like, even put the physiology to the side for a second, who is having fun checking their HRM every 15 seconds just so they get to run at a pace which is physically frustrating in how slow it is?  Part of developing as a runner is finding ways to make the activity of running enjoyable, exploring the range of paces and intensities is a huge part of that, and many posters on this sub are way too quick to jettison that because they have this impression that actually exerting yourself on a run is going to leave your body in shambles.

I know many people understand this principle, but I thought I would put a fine point on it, ""Slow down"" is effective advice in about 1 out of every 8 instances it is given on this subreddit.

I am supposed to be running my first marathon at the end of this month (Sept 27th). I ran a half in May and felt great at the end, zero issues, so I kept up my training at the same pace (including rest weeks) to get me to my marathon. Here is my issue:

THIS IS SO HARD and for the first time EVER, I am afraid I won't be able to do this. I made it to 16-18 mile long runs, but then had to start alternating walking/running toward the end. My body is tired ALL the time and my average pace for my short easy runs (&lt;5 miles) has slowed down by 1:30-2:00 min/mile. My nutrition hasn't changed and I'm taking extra rest days if my body needs it based on how it feels and my resting HR. I did a 20 mile run last Sat and felt sick at the end, not looking forward to my next/last 20 miler before my race.

Is this normal for my first marathon? Did I overtrain?

Just bought some Merrell Trail glove 5. I've always had issues finding a pair of shoes that fit me, some shoes I fit size 11uk, some 11.5uk, and others size 12, depending on the brand. This is the first time i have bought some barefoot/minimalist shoes.

I bought the Merrel trail gloves 5 in size 11.5uk and they seem to fit me fine, but when walking/running the toe box is big and I can see the netting creasing up, giving the look as though they are too big. When I walk/run in shoes they feel fine, but the material on the shoes gives the impression that there is a lot of sack in the toe box.

I know if I size down my toes will push to the front and if I size up they'll be way too big.

Just wondering if anyone has the Merrel trail glove 5's and have come across the same thing or if the shoe is meant to be like this.

And at the start of July I stopped running to put on some muscle, happened pretty fast bc this was my first ever “bulk”. 500 calorie surplus(~3k cal). It’s been two months, 20lbs later and I’m pretty happy how it ended. I definitely started with some fat (~13% BF, I have one of those techy scales from amazon that reads everything about you) so I plan on losing half.. maybe more bc I’ve never been very lean. I didn’t put much emphasis on the macros, just as long as I hit my calorie goal, &gt;200g of protein, and avoided fat when I could. Carbs were high. I weigh 190lb currently. 

The training for a marathon I plan on running starts next week and continuing to bulk is not ideal. I will continue to lift to maintain muscle and my calorie deficit plan is 10-15%. I’ll definitely throw this question in a lifting subreddit but I identify more with this group so I’m putting it here first. 

What should my macros/diet look like in order to keep my muscle and perform on my runs during this deficit? That’s a tall order and Im not anticipating detailed answers but this is the bridge I’m trying to cross.

I've tried to read as much on here as I can and follow the - in my perception - best advice to transition from a person who ""just runs"" to someone who takes their running more seriously.

Slow down. Add miles. Build slowly. Don't get hurt.

So here I am, several weeks later, as stated in my title. The running feels good and I'm thrilled to be covering even 23 miles in a week, but is that enough volume to get faster or do I need to add more miles... because running more than 5 hours a week seems kind of excessive to me.

I'm going by the Maffletone Method, which I understand can take 6 months to start seeing results, but I just wanted to be sure before I invest 114 hours (give or take) to the pursuit.

Here's what my weekly runs look like:

* Long - 8 mi.
* Short - 2.5 mi.
* Trails and Hills - 4 mi.
* Medium - 6 mi.

- HIIT 1-2x/week (jump rope heavy)

Whenever I do C25K, my goal is to do cardio for a longer period so I pace my jogging slower. I tried to better my breathing technique by following “in my nose, out my mouth” with my stomach out. The treadmill hovers around 5 speed. I’ve tried going slower and faster and I feel the same. 

It feels like I can’t catch my breath fully, like I NEED to take a deep breath of air and when I try to, it feels like I only got half of what I need. So I’m constantly wanting air. It feels almost suffocating and unbearable, but at the end I’m able to push through it. It just sucks the entire time.

So much so, that I signed up for a half marathon in April.  My training was going excellent, I was running about 25-30ish miles a week, including my long runs on the weekend which were 8-11 miles.  Then Covid hit and my run was cancelled.  I was super bummed, and fell off the wagon for running for a bit, but got back into it in May, and in June I felt good enough to sign up for another half marathon to makeup for the one that had been cancelled.  In late June I got sick, then right after I got better I had a 2 week long vacation.  When I got back in Mid/late July, I promised myself I would start training hard for my half marathon on 9/20/20.

I got lazy and didn't do any training until the end of August.  Now, with the race coming up in 16 days, how crazy would I be for attempting it?  I'm a 22M in pretty decent physical shape, and my starting point for training was obviously a bit better than it had been when I first started this past winter, but I did lose quite a bit of my endurance and strength.

I'm not worried about my time or if I have to walk more than I typically would want, but I just want some perspective on if this is something I should even try.  My main concern would be injury.

3503,3503,3503,7,Never had lower leg problems until now.,1599192029,"TLDR: Finally started consistently running again. All road. Calf &amp; soleus pain/strain. Switched back to shoes that I had used in the past. More supportive, but still having pain/swelling. Never had lower leg problems before. WTH?


I've had upper leg problems in the past, but never lower leg problems. I ran XC &amp; track in high school and had the occasional hammy/quad problems, but never calf/soleus problems. I gained some weight 20 years later (40+ lbs). I've ran on and off in stretches  since then. I started to push myself 2 years ago to drop the weight and back into running shape. I'm a work-at-home dad (stuck at home) so in the past 2 years I was only relying on an elliptical - only the bottom half so you use your core to balance and it worked pretty well. I dropped a lot of weight &amp; put on muscle. When I started to get to 20 miles on the elliptical a day and peaked, something needed to change. I finally started to get out there and run since Covid because schedules changed. I started slowly with a mile or 2 every other day, all road. I felt like my body was in-shape, but my lungs were dead after a mile. I never experienced this weird disconnect before. I worked my way up to 3 miles 3-4 days a week. I was starting to have calf and soleus injuries. I realized my shoes were too soft and went back to my older 8505's temporarily, which never gave me problems in the past. But I'm still having swelling/pain in both my calf and soleus. Mostly in my left leg. Could my lower legs be too weak? Could it just be the road &amp; shoes?

Today I hit 24:10 on a 5km run, absolutely shattering my previous PR of 27:30. It’s been a goal of mine to run my fastest 5km time before 30 years old and I’m stoked because I managed to beat it by a large margin. 

I had previously never been able to do better than a 5:30/km pace even when working pretty hard and pushing myself in my runs. 

What happened was my friend asked me to go for a run together and when we started he came out with a blitzing pace of around 4:45/km. Being competitive (and more so not wanting to be embarrassed), I just tried to keep up with him.  

I kept going and going with the goal of trying to keep up for as long as I could and when we finally finished the 5km I was absolutely shocked to see me destroy my previous time. 

I’m super proud and one thing I’ve been reflecting on is how impactful it can be to run with someone better than you so it gives you a visible level to work towards.

3510,3510,3510,14,Endurance running has been linked to poor heart health.,1599182784,"I just ran into some information that has me perplexed. Endurance running is not what I grew up thinking it was? I stumbled across this information earlier today. And I honestly would like get some more insight into this newly found information. 

 First I would like to provide a little background about myself. I am a 28 year old male that inconsistently runs. I grew up with a father who was a cereal marathon runner. Who dabbled in a bit of shorter distance runs myself when I was younger. The most memorable race I was in was one in Italy I think called “Run to the tower”. 

 I also played soccer growing up and ended up playing in college. I used to be very active. Today not so much. Like I said my running is inconsistent. Mostly because my situation now is vastly different from what it was when I was in college. But I have been slowing getting back into it because I am a firm believer in investing in my health. 

 However when I do run I always have this mentality of maybe pushing myself I bit too far. Like the one more rep kind of stuff. For instance I would set a time for myself to stop after 20 min of a pretty fast pace. Instead of stopping though, I would say I can do 10 more min &amp; then again another 10. 

Some of the information I ran into was about this guy named Greg Welch who used to be a cereal champion of multiple triathletes. He has a book called “The heart of a champion”. It’s about his success and fall after having a catastrophic heart issue at a young age.

3523,3523,3523,27,I am being stalked by a man on my evening runs.,1599175364,"I run at a park about six blocks from my home. Honestly, it’s the perfect running location. Each lap around is half a mile, so it’s easy to calculate my distance. My dad lives right across the street from it, so I can go to his house if I need water or to use the restroom. It’s within walking distance from my house. 

I’ve started running in the evenings since my classes started and I student teach during the days, so the evenings is when I have the time to run. But two nights this week, the same man has started following me. Both nights, my mother was also watching me in her car to make sure I was safe. He would follow me over and over the first night, circling the park, slowing waaaay down as he passed me, and pulling up ahead of me so I had to pass him. My mom confronted him the first night, but he pretended like he wasn’t following me and parked at the other end of the park for the rest of my run. My mom’s boyfriend called the cops the next day and the said they’d start patrolling in the area more. The next day, I didn’t see him, but last night, I did again.

At first I couldn’t tell if it was him. I saw him on my last lap, and he went passed me pretty quickly. My mom was in the area picking up my brother from my dad’s. I started walking down my street after I finished the run. The street itself isn’t that well lit. He started following me down it, and only stopped when she chased him off. She followed him for a few blocks, but he lost her, and he started following me again. I panicked, turned back toward the park, and then turned down an even darker street out of fear. Thankfully, my mom came back, he got spooked, and she followed me home. We called the cops again and they repeated that they will patrol, but since he’s “not committing any crime,” there’s not much they can do.

I posted about this on my town’s community FB page and it blew up. Several women said he has followed, stalked, and harassed them, both while they were on foot or in their own vehicles.

I’m just really upset. I love running at the park and I’m not going to give up my running spot. I’m also going to keep going in the evenings until it gets cooler. It’s so hot any other time of day where I am.  And I hate exercising with other people. Running is my time to just be alone with my thoughts and enjoy my run. I always carry pepper spray, but I’m not confident in my ability to use it if a man was actually attacking me. I feel like my chances of running away are better.

3524,3524,3524,28,New pain with new shoes... coincidence or are the shoes the problem?,1599175069,"I have never really been a runner. I ran track in high school, but basically just to stay fit and didn't take it seriously-- I'm not a competitive or athletic person. Because I wasn't running when I started, and then was pushed to increase my mileage, I spent a lot of the time dealing with shin splints and tendonitis. I also think that I tore my meniscus skiing at some point, and that frequently flared up and caused pain. Ended up quitting after a couple of years of minimal progress and kind of hating running. Tried starting again a few times in college and would run into the same issues. Finally accepted that I would never be able to run without pain, and stuck to low impact exercise from then on.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, I decided to try running again this year after about four full years off. I had no real goals or expectations, but started C25k pretty cautiously. I was genuinely surprised to find that I was able to run with no pain at all, and was enjoying it more than I ever had before. I stopped running during quarantine for a few months, and decided to restart C25k from the beginning a little over a month ago because I like the structure and the progression. I have been feeling great, and really enjoying feeling a little fitter than square 1 (I like lifting weights but my cardio is generally lacking... these have been some of the first times I've been able to run without feeling like I couldn't breath the whole time).  So that being said, I think I've been running harder in the past couple of weeks than I have in quite a while, just because I'm feeling like I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this ""new chapter"" of running has been done in the shoes I got at the end of high school, **Saucony Guide 6's**. They're from after I quit track, so they didn't have much mileage on them even though they're old. I believe that I got them from a running shoe store that fit me for them. They are completely comfortable for me when running-- I honestly have never thought about them all that much because I mostly don't really notice them. The problem is that I have completely shredded the heels of the shoes from the inside, down to the plastic, and now the plastic cuts into my heels and gives me cuts. This happens to the vast majority of shoes that I own, not just running shoes. All of my socks eventually wear all the way through at the heel, even thick wool ones. Almost all shoes give me blisters on my heels, including sneakers.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided that since I'm actually enjoying running now, and my shoes are basically slicing me, it was time to get myself back to a running shoe store and get fitted for a new pair. I thought it went great! They told me that a lot of the problem I have with blisters on my heels is probably because my instep is very low, in addition to lower arches, which essentially means I don't fill shoes all the way and leave room for my foot to move up and down and when I walk. This made a lot of sense to me, as I often need to tighten the laces or buckles on shoes to the point that they look silly. Feet are a normal width, and I was told that I pronate mildly, and heel strike pretty hard. I tried on a bunch of pairs, and wasn't crazy about most of them. Most seemed fine, but felt as though my foot was going to wiggle around in the same way or otherwise felt a little weird to me-- not the ""barely noticeable"" feel that I was used to. Finally, I tried on the **Mizuno Wave Inspire's** and they felt awesome! My feet felt completely locked in and secure, and I loved it-- no heel wiggle at all. They did feel stiffer than my old shoes, but they were really comfortable and natural feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thrilled right up until I brought them home and ran with them. I only ran about 2 miles, and I found myself nagged with all kinds of weird pains. My calves and shins felt sore, which I figured could be normal for new shoes. But then I had a weird pain on the outside of my ankle that I had never had before. And then by the end, my knees were aching on impact every step, at the front kind of under my knee cap-- this is what really freaked me out, because I've honestly never experienced any kind of joint pain at all before (I'm a 24 year old woman, 120 lbs, always been healthy). A dull pain around my fifth metatarsal/pinky toe joint that has been barely present for the past few weeks was suddenly almost throbbing, to the point that I actually got it x-rayed because I was worried it was a stress fracture-- it's not, which has me wondering if it's something that could have been exasperated by the shoes? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also worried that the shoes could be too small. I tried the same size in all of the shoes, including the Wave Inspires, but didn't notice until I ran in them that my toes are closer to the front than they were in most of the other pairs. This is consistent with online reviews that say they run a bit small. So that's also kind of decreased my trust in the judgement of the sales guys, if he really sent me home with shoes that are too small and didn't notice. I'm worried I was basically pushed into buying expensive sneakers when maybe I could've just bought last year's Saucony Guides for cheap online... 

&amp;#x200B;

So I know this is super long, but basically, I'm wondering what things I should be concerned about and what things I shouldn't be? Or is there anything that indicates a problem with the shoes rather than a coincidental overuse problem? I've taken two days off, and feel pretty much 100% other than the weird foot pain (although it's much less acute now... doctor offered to refer me to a podiatrist?). I'm considering going for a run in my old shoes just to see if any of these weird problems persist? Should I try the Inspires again? Just not sure what to do I guess! Also any advice for what I should look for in shoes?

I started to see a cardiologist after I passed out after finishing a brutal 8k. After a lot of testing, they ruled that it wouldn't be safe to run anymore.

I started slow, just walking, and then started slowly adding in periods of jogging by running for 30 seconds and walking for 2-3 minutes until I got used to it.  Things were going well, I was getting stronger and breathing better and then it happened.  One step was fine and the next step was painful.  The pain is mostly on the lower inside part of my knee.  It's persisted for a couple of months although it's not as bad now, and I have some days I don't really feel the knee pain much.  If I take an anti-inflammatory I can be pain-free pretty much.  

So here is my question.  Understanding that this isn't actual medical advice and just the opinions of fellow runners (lol), what are the chances I've actually torn something or otherwise have an injury that might need medical attention?  I have no insurance right now so I haven't been able to see a doctor.  It seems like if I had an actual tear or other injury I would still feel pain on some level even with anti-inflammatory (Meloxicam).  Doing squats doesn't bother it but certain lunging movements do.   And if I'm sitting down there is no way I can ""criss-cross applesauce"" without pain.  

Just looking for advice.  I want to get back in sooner rather than later but I don't want to risk further injury.  Trying to decide if I can do some rehab exercises on my own to see if it improves.

42,160 meters divided by the average stride length means he took an estimated 22,073 steps during the race.

Elite 5% runners - according to Garmin data - have a ground contact time of 210ms or below.  I don't have a value for Kipchoge, but if we assume it's that or less ... that's about 420ms on the ground per full stride ... yes?  That should mean he spent about 42% of his time in contact with the ground (50 minutes) and the remainder of the time (69 minutes) in the air.

Does that seem about right?

3554,3554,3554,58,“Missing Marathon season” by Peter Bromka [copied and pasted],1599156112,"Missing Marathon Season
With that first-morning chill, Summer signals its approaching departure, and the Fall beckons. A welcome sign for runners, that strikes fear in racers, cause you’d better be fit for the work that’s about to begin: Marathon Season.

Fall signals weekends committed to work and weeks set to build sequentially.

Of momentum that sounds like a whisper at first, then builds to a full volume of intense training stacked back-to-back-to-back, and eventually escalates to an impending scream that you hold...hold...hold... only to let out with exclamation on Race Day.

Fall is the time before the traditional Holidays, a runner’s holiday. A season of meaning where every action feels significant. Where each sleep, most meals, and all runs build to something that holds collective importance because we’ve declared our intent to each other.

A season when time is so ingrained that we greet one another knowingly,
""Just 5 weeks to go now, eh?""
""Yup, how many for you, only 3?""
""Yeah, almost time to taper!""
 

The effort is agreed. 
The intent is implied.
The meaning is understood.
 

Fall is the season so filled with efforts that each Sunday bursts like a sequence of fireworks building to a crescendo of inspiration and awe. Victories and records. Thousands of personal bests. So many performances that even the most novice runner is left questioning, “Maybe next year could that be me?”
 

The season arcs knowingly, aware that while partiers who frolicked in Summer pack away their beach bag and bemoan the loss of sunlight, racers await ideal temperatures to rev their internal engines. Checking weather patterns frantically, updating repeatedly, the Fall racer’s heart flutters at the first sign of a crisp sunlit morning. 

Searching for sweat-stained layers from past efforts, the Fall racer unpacks a favorite pair of gloves, a lucky beanie, even full tights that seemed absurd only weeks ago during humidity soaked Summer sessions.

Ambitions calibrated to match the conditions of the day, taking care not to overexert on impulse or under-endeavor out of fear. To find the appropriate pace that speaks only to you amidst the clamoring footfalls of the crowd.

Fall is built on hope.
Hope that numbers that appeared impossible under Summer sun are now maybe just manageable after months of repetition. 

And acceptance.
Acceptance that although this much effort over 26.2 miles might never actually feel easy, that you are now accustomed to the flashes of fear and panic that are sent expectedly from a body under duress.  

The Fall marathoner heads out the door into layers of grit, soil, and rot with a growing intent to create something before years end. Though the natural seasonal cycle of death marks the calendar coming to a close, the Marathoner knows that with commitment they still have a chance to create something beautiful before it ends.

Fall training functions for the Marathoner’s mind like an ice cube tray for time. While the hours, days, and weeks of life can often feel fluid, lacking form or direction, marathon training organizes them into something rigid, sequential, and purposeful.

But sadly, not this season.
Which hurts.
An indulgent pain for sure, overshadowed by a global pandemic, but an ache none the less. The marathon community longs for the chance to celebrate once again. 
To feel collective meaning together.

Setbacks.
Disappointments. 
Having to begin again.
In many ways, Marathoners are as prepared for this season of distress as anyone. Who among us hasn’t commenced a training cycle with high hopes only to reach its completion somewhere entirely unexpected?

No, this is not an offseason.
Though starting lines are suspended and the chance to lose ourselves in the energy of mass races is on hold indefinitely, we must not toss aside this Fall entirely.

The Fall of 2020 will not be a historical racing season, but we must force ourselves back onto our front foot. After months of fear, uncertainty, and anxiety, this Fall is a call to return to the cadence and camaraderie of the life-affirming work we know well, for no greater reason than the fact that days wrapped around this exhausting hobby leave us physically empty and emotionally full.

Yes, this will hurt, but on our terms. 
We must once again form our weeks with routine.
Must collectively rededicate to progress, improvement, and hope.
And must remember that, even absent the traditional Race Day culmination, the true gift of living a Fall marathon season is completing the year having wrung every ounce of effort and experience from its final days.",running,imahntr,False,/r/running/comments/ilymnp/missing_marathon_season_by_peter_bromka_copied/

Some background on me: 36M, fairly new to running. I've always played sports or lifted weights to stay in fairly decent shape, but until recently I thought I couldn't run longer than about 3 miles or 30 minutes. At the beginning of quarantine a few months ago, I got inspired to start working toward doing some triathlons, with a long-term goal of doing a full Ironman in a couple of years. As an initial step toward this, I decided to start training for a half-marathon. There is one in my area scheduled for December, and whether or not it is actually held I am planning to run a half marathon that weekend. To give some idea of my current fitness level, my recent best times are 10k in 54:07, 5k in 26:12 and a 6:50 mile.

I started one of the Garmin coach programs (with Jeff Galloway) a few weeks ago to give me some guidance. Prior to starting, I was running about 5-10 miles per week at about 9:00-9:30 min/mile. My main goal for the race is to finish, since I have never run that distance before. Secondary goal is to finish under two hours. When setting up the Garmin coach program, since I was starting almost 4 months out, I put in an even loftier goal of finishing under 1:45, with an 8:00 min/mile pace.

Recently, I've had a couple of workouts that include race pace repeats, 800m x 5. Although it recommends I run these at a pace of 7:45-8:00 min/mile based on my goal pace, I find that I can fairly easily push faster than that and run them at a pace between 7:00-7:15 min/mile, since they are fairly short and I only have to do 5 of them. This week, I see I have a workout coming up called Speed Repeats which suggests I should run 7:15-7:30 pace, so I guess this is what I have already been doing.

So my question is, should I slow down when I'm supposed to be doing my goal race pace even though I feel like I can go faster? I feel like my tertiary goal of an 8:00 min/mile pace for a half marathon is pretty lofty as I've never even run that distance before, so I don't think that setting a faster goal pace is necessarily the answer.

I'm looking for some recommendations for a pair of runners to replace my ageing Nike Free 3.0 V4s.

I really like the low offset, the smaller stack height (tall enough to not make me worry about too harsh an experience), and the wide toe box. The sole is not totally squishy but it encourages me to have a faster cadence so it still feels a bit springy. 

Some models which are bandied about a lot are Saucony Kinvara, Brooks Pureflow, and Altra Escalante.

The Kinvara seems quite tall from a stack height point of view however, it's reported as being lightweight and a bit snappy. It seems from my research that the Escalante would be the most similar to the Free 3.0 though.

3570,3570,3570,74,Chased by two different dogs in the last week. I just searched this sub and Jesus Christ why does this happen so often?,1599145966," Been running for about three years. I started out just around my  complex, then towards the mains roads, and now I use a route that goes from my complex to a suburban neighborhood of family homes, and then  toward a main intersection. I like this route because it's scenic and  there are three major law enforcement agencies within one block.  I'm now considering not running in the suburban area because two dog  chases within one week is not worth it if I could still run on the sidewalk along a main road where I don't have to worry about loose dogs running out of their house or running from their owner.  

I use bone conduction headphones when running so that I can still be aware of my surroundings, I highly recommend them because I would not have heard either dog before they got close to me. The first dog was a cute pitbull mix that had broken loose from it's chain and kept going after me because he wanted to play. The only thing that kept him away from me was petting him and rubbing his belly for a bit after yelling at him to stop chasing me. 

The second one I was very close to actually kicking or shooting. I carry a gun, I have a concealed carry permit and train with it regularly. I've seen a lot of runners being mugged in my hometown and also carry everywhere I go in general. This dog was much more aggressive. I run probably between 5 and 6  mph at most, so it's not like I was sprinting. The weird thing is , I was actually thinking for a moment ""Hey this is near the area that pitbull started chasing me, good thing he ended up just being lonely and wanting a belly rubb...oh shit"" and then I heard something to my left and turned around and saw an aggressive boxer running after me. I turned around really quickly and yelled ""BACK!"" (I don;t know why my brain only said this) and pushed my hand in front. He stopped for a bit and was about 10 feet from me, barked and started running again and I yelled at it again and stared him down until he turned around towards his house. 

The owner didn't do shit and didn't seem to care that the dog was aggressively chasing me. Not at all an ""oh he just wants to play and doesn't know his strength.""  No. This dog would have attacked me. I had so much adrenaline in that moment. I even yelled ""sorry"" when the dog went back to the house, not because I was actually sorry, but because I was so caught up with the adrenalin's rush that I just said something before going back to my pace. 

I've seen other people here have the mentality that you shouldn't change your route due to owners who don't manage their pets. However, I'm starting to realize the thought of me being attacked or me potentially having to draw/use a gun on a dog is not worth it if I could potentially avoid it all together. This is also part of the south, so there are a number of dogs here that are used mainly for hunting and I always have that in the back of my mind when I'm out.",running,jrr24601,False,/r/running/comments/ilv9oq/chased_by_two_different_dogs_in_the_last_week_i/

Hi all,

I've (25f) been running on and off for 5 years or so - have done a 10k, a 15k and a half marathon a few years ago - but have really got back into it during lockdown and am enjoying it more.

I'm doing all ""easy"" runs, i guess - just daily trots along the river for exercise and mental health. On weekdays it's normally about 6, 6.5km, and on weekends I might stretch to 8-10 if i have a good enough podcast to get through. Obviously I'm hardly about to become elite, but I'm hoping to improve my pace on easy runs, so I started looking into the MAF method.

My normal, sustainable pace for a daily run, which i'm doing 5/6 times a week, is about 5:30-5:40/km. Not super fast to begin with. With MAF, it's somewhere around 6:30 at the absolute fastest with my heart rate at \~160. 

It's really, really counterintuitive to run so slowly (for me) and do so much walking, and I'm still working towards getting my heart rate down and not letting my pride get the better of me! 

I know that will improve quickly  - but I guess my question is, given i'm not about to run a half or a marathon, is heart rate/MAF training actually still going to be good for me, or am I just slowing myself down for no real benefit?

So, this is the shape I'm in:

* I recently lost about 70 lbs. over the course of a year. I'm still overweight at 26% body fat. ( I was morbidly obese) I'm also 56 years old.
* I ran on and off on a treadmill to lose weight but mostly stuck to resistance training because running hurt. But now I enjoy it. My resistance training now consists of swinging a kettlebell and some body weight work outs and HIIT.
* *I couldn't run half a mile a year ago*. Now I like to run up hills, run trails, hike and I walk at least 5 miles a day at anywhere from 14 to 15 minute miles. (it used to take me 20 minutes).
* My fastest mile is 8.26 minutes. I was shocked.
* I can run 3 miles in about 29 to 28 minutes and actually enjoy it.
* I can run five to six miles three times a week and not sore the following day. 
* Obviously, I'm still a very slow runner but at least I actually have fun doing it because it doesn't hurt any more. I don't get shin splints any more (which is really weird because I always did growing up). I run faster than when I was a teenager. I wrestled and played football in HS.
*  I've seen good runners, they're stick figures with with Bruce Lee muscles (LOL!) I'm not like that. I'm still a big guy with a puffy gut (it's smaller!!!) but I am improving. 

So... **Can I actually start training for half-marathon?** Or do I still have a lot of work to do with conditioning and building running endurance?

I tried a number of different shoes for my ""overpronated"" right foot (only) and couldnt figure out how they were supposed to help. My feet always found a way as I moved to revert to its bad form and felt weird in the shoe. Especially with the advice that you get to size up in running shoes. 

Then I realized that the only way your foot falls in the specific form where the ""helpful technology"" lies is if you very intentionally heel strike and hit the sweet spot on the outside of your heel to roll through to your big toe. For a number of reasons in my case, that works against my natural inclination to do at least a midfoot strike AND it works against what I need to do to keep good alignment while Im running. I still will run in the two pairs of ""modern"" ""supportive"" running shoes I bought, but only considering them as a training tool/mental cue, NOT a corrective measure. 

The only way those shoes work in my opinion is if you are already strong enough with good form to the point you dont need them. I accept now that the only way they will help me is if I constantly stop to adjust them. I ordered some saucony bullets, because I dont think my route really works for a vibram type shoe.

I am M/36, I run 4-5 times a week in the morning, usually 4mi each. I also lift weights and do legs twice a week, including heavy squats on Sundays.

I'm finding a persistent pain and tightness just behind my right hip. Its the kind of muscle that feels like im kind of stretching it if I do crow/crow variations for those who do yoga, or any kind of twist stretch. But none of those stretches have absolved the issue. I have tried foam rolling, which doesn't seem to do anything, or rolling around on a lacrosse ball, which is incredibly painful and also doesn't seem to do it. I've gotten sports massages, I stretch every night, I stretch before and after lifting and before and after running. Ive tried NOT stretching, to see if that was the problem, it was not. 

So I am kind of frustrated and unsure what to do. I took time off running, came back, and its still there. I went to a sports doctor, who sucked and referred me to a physical therapist, who also sucked and just took my money.

Does anyone else have this issue? I recognize it is a result of lifting AND running - my gym was shut down for 3 months during the height of lockdowns and I didn't have the problem too badly anymore. But when my gym reopened and I started back on the weights, it began to flare up. I realized I need to find the right balance with running and lifting, and have indeed stepped back to 4 days a week running with 2 full no-run days after my heavy squat Sunday.

I’ve gone through a few programs before. I started out just doing the Nike Run club “guided runs” every couple of days depending on how I felt (always like a relaxed recovery run.) Eventually I began one of the workout plans they have (get started) and was enjoying it. Eventually of course life got in the way and I missed one day which turned into one week and I quit the program because I didn’t like that I had missed so many prescribed workouts. I’ve started those NRC training programs several times only to get about halfway through one before something comes up (life happens.)

I’ve also tried various other running plans (C25K, Hal Higdon training plans, creating my own, etc.)

Somewhere down the line though I always end up falling off, taking a few days/weeks/months off running and noticing that what little progress I felt like I made from the last stretch was gone.

3631,3631,3631,39,Lessons learned from 1st 100 mile month,1599090791,"Tl;dr Humidity impacts performance, cross training is important, trying for something (anything!) can boost morale.

I ran my first 100 miles in a month this past August. I got the idea in little before June because Garmin brought out at badge for running 100 miles in a month. 

Prior to this, I had been off and on with running. Going way back 7-8 years, I had run 2 marathons. Took a long break from running (background prior was in an anaerobic sports), and surfaced back with some 5ks and a couple 1/2 marathons the last 3 years. I switched jobs last summer and found myself running to deal with the stress like a lot of other folks. Eventually decided on a 1/2 marathon for this past April, and in February, had logged 56.7 (most for me at the time in a month) miles including PRs in a 5k and 10k.  Midway through March things came to stand still due to pandemic.

I started to pick it up again at the end of May, and then with this Garmin badge goal, thought why not go for it. It’s roughly ~3.3 ish miles a day for a month. And yes, I know that sounds crazy because rest is important! Anyway, I pick it back up in June and naturally tweak my knee and hamstring. I take time off and and was fairly discouraged. I try to pick it back up in July (another badge made available, so a chance for redemption), but lose some momentum and know I’m not going to make it. Still, I’m running more than I had been and though it’s brutally hot, try to keep at it. Log 61.5 miles, topping my prior most in a month. 

Even not making the 100 miles, it still felt pretty good seeing how much more I had ran than in the past. August I thought I’d give it a shot since I was in a routine and feeling good. I was prioritizing my rest days and including longer runs in the week which became something to love/hate, but an interesting distraction to focus on. A small getaway in the middle of the month had me not run at all for 3 days in a row, but I bounced back and finished August with 100.4 miles. 

I feel like I learned a few things. One, humidity and heat hinders my personal performance way more than the cold. I did tie my 5K PR from February in the summer, but did not reach my best pace in my longer runs. And I felt the difference sweating my butt off. Two, cross training helps. My running in the Winter was mixed with some other activities. I was on the bike trainer a lot and did some more body weight exercises. This summer, I had tunnel vision focusing only on hitting the road and trying to get my run in. I feel like I was not as strong, which may have played a part with not achieving my faster pace. 

My big mistake is Garmin did not have a 100 mile running badge for August, the whole reason I had this idea to begin with (that’s a joke, but also a legit bummer for me). Either way, I’m happy I went through this experience. Not training for anything in particular now, but feel like I have a solid foundation. Slight fear that I prioritized quantity over quality during this experiment, but now I can put a larger focus on incorporating interval training and the other cross training.

3636,3636,3636,44,Haven't ran consistently in probably 8 years and I finally ran under a 10-minute mile!,1599086828,"I haven't ran consistently since I was involved with sports in high school.  Since I went to college academics, extra-curriculars, relationships, life, etc. sort of took over my life.  I was never a good runner to begin with, but I was fairly decent in gym and during dry land workouts for my swim team.  Fast-forward to now and I'm 26, getting married, and I weight 70 pounds more than I did going into college.  About a month and a half ago, I decided to make a change.

Instead of buying shitty running shoes from Walmart, I invested in some actual running shoes that were meant for me.  I have terrible flat feet, so this made a huge difference.  The first 2 weeks were really tough, but I changed my mentality from ""running sucks"" to ""being out of shape sucks.""  Slowly I went from ""i think my heart is going to explode if I run any longer"" to ""im going to push myself to go that extra half mile.""

Today, I hit my 20th run.  I also hit under an average pace of 10 min/mile, something I haven't done in a very very long time. I have also been shedding weight and have been feeling better than ever. I am now under 200 lbs.  While I'm tall, that is still a massive achievement for me.

 Honestly, I couldn't have done it without some perspective changes that this sub helped me see.  So I just want to say thank you, and that you all have solidified a new hobby for me.  I look forward to running now.  My wife and doctor couldn't be happier.

Yesterday I set off with two buddies around midnight to see if I could walk 100,000 steps in one day. I was always under the impression that this was easily doable and, in hindsight, I seriously regret my naivete. 

[Strava proof of completion](https://ibb.co/ws1T491)

I'm not sure why Strava and my step counter differ regarding the distance, however Google maps said the distance was 78KM in total, so I'm going to go with that

Route:

- I live in Southern Ontario, Canada so the number of straight long paths available to me was plentiful. I decided to walk the G2G trail from a rural town called Milverton, all the way to Goderich (see my strava post).

The Walk:

- Set off at midnight to maximize my chance of completing this daft challenge and minimize my time in the sun. Walked at about 12 mins/km (a casual pace), with 5-10 min breaks each 10,000 steps. Unfortunately couldn't fall asleep the day before the challenge so I was doing this very sleep deprived.

- First 30,000 steps were easy (5ish hours). However, thereafter the pain really kicked in. Bit concerning since there was still 70,000 steps to go... Tightness in hamstrings and calves and just very sore feet.

- Friends opted for a powernap at 50,000 steps. My gait was larger than theirs so I walked while they slept to catch up on steps. Incredible tightness and pain at this point. 

- 65,000 steps: Got shit on by a bird. 

- Pace dropped dramatically for the remaining steps. Legs could barely move and each step was physically unpleasant. Having others with you is definitely a must-have.

I thought to address this question to you. I play a lot of soccer, and have been for years. I am thus highly conditioned for sprinting. Two days ago, I decided to go on a short, slow-paced run. Haven't done this in months. I went running for thirteen minutes before stopping, and not at a fast pace (it felt like a 6.5 on the treadmill). After I stopped to walk, my legs felt EXTREMELY tense. If I tried to start running again, it sort of felt like my legs had way too much pressure and it felt like I had less control over them mechanically? The thing is that I RARELY get sore after an intense soccer game on my quads. I usually feel it more in my glute/hip area.  


The next two days, my legs are very sore to the touch (not so sore when actually walking). I ran this morning for about 6-7 minutes and didn't have the same experience. But really confused why a less demanding run two days ago has me sorer than my sprints? Is it because of my Type I and Type II fibers being disproportionately conditioned? Has anyone else experienced that really intense pressure feeling on their legs after one suddenly stops from a run? Is it just that my quads are way too tight?",running,philosophyaway,False,/r/running/comments/ilbp3y/unusually_tense_and_sore_quads_immediately_after/

Add a scoop of whey powder (30 grams protein), a cup of chopped nuts (15 grams of protein approx) and if you have any protein rich flours add in a bit.  Also, add some wheat germ for some healthy goodness.  I also put a tiny amount of coconut in but that's not needed really.  Less is more with coconut.  Oh, hershey syrup.  Use that too!  Add an extra 1/4 cup of water because of the added flours.  Mix all liquid parts together and all dry parts together.  Then mix everything and put into 12x9 glass plate.  Cook as directed.  I recommend the larger plate because these brownies get thicker than normal because of the extra ingredients.  It also cooks more evenly this way.

Some backstory: I (27M) hit my limit a few weeks ago. I'm 6'3 and I have always had a large build, but I finally topped out at 250 lbs and decided it was time to kick myself into gear. I was athletic growing up, but I fear that those days are long gone. My wife and I decided it was time to work together to get back into shape. I am hoping to lose \~30-40lbs (does this seem like a good amount?) while my wife hopes to lose \~15.

2 weeks ago we started waking up M/W/F at 5am and going to the track across the street for a morning run. We're using the C25K app, which we had used about 2 years ago before successfully completing a 5k. We also go for a half mile walk with our kids every day when I get home from work just for some extra exercise and family bonding time. Beyond that, we have both started walking at least a mile during our work day - She walks outside and I walk the perimeter of my office repetitively. This is our current routine.

The first day my legs were jelly. I expected that. The second day I started to get really bad blisters half way through and I decided to call the run quits, immediately deciding I had to get some better shoes. I purchased a pair of Saucony Omni (Good shoes?) as they seemed to fit my arches best and after learning that I ""pronate"" - a word that is entirely new to my vocabulary. I got some blister resistant socks and some leg compressions, too.

We're now 2 weeks in and the C25K training is getting a bit tougher. This morning I felt like I just couldn't do it. I powered through and finished the run, but felt as though my ankles would collapse at any minute. I've heard people in r/GetMotivated say that you shouldn't push your body too hard and to listen to your body and to know your limits. But I wasn't sure if this was my limit, or simply one of those trials in which I needed to push through it to get stronger. I decided on the latter - after all, I didn't want to leave my wife running alone in the dark.

My primary issue 2 years ago as we (mildly) trained for the 5k was my shin splints. Every time I ran it felt like I was so stiff. This time around, however, it is all in my ankles. They burn, they feel tight, and they feel like giving out. Especially the inside of my ankles, which I am sure has something to do with pronating. The shin splints are still there a bit, but nowhere near what they used to be.

I am now sitting in my office and the pain I felt this morning feels like a distant memory, so I know I'm fine - but guys... this sucks. I want so badly to enjoy running and to feel comfortable and excited to wake up at 5am and just make it happen.

I know I'm super early in the game here as it has only been 2 weeks. So maybe the pain I feel is normal. But also, maybe there is something I need to be doing to alleviate the pain that I haven't stumbled upon yet.

So my questions are: Does the pain go away? If so, how long does that take? And finally, if you have any advice to share I'd be more than happy to take it.

So here is is... 
I've had my MIL staying with me for a while now, which for the most part has been ok, however, last night she had her cousin and 11 year old daughter swing by my place for a cuppa. Cousin and daughter had been in 5 minutes when I hear her mention that daughter had been off school and when MIL asked why, she said it was for a sore leg. Phew, I thought!
I venture out of my room to say hello and ask how the cousin is, and she replies with ""not great""... ""Why?"" I ask. She then tells me she has this ""horrible cold"" and then I remember she's an insane covid denying moron. Great...

Long story short, I've been very careful covid wise. Paranoid, some have said, but whatever. I very quickly feel a surge of adrenaline, serious fight or flight feelings. In that moment, I don't know if I'm going to scream, cry, or just straight up punch this selfish, ignorant B**TARD who's currently sitting on my sis next to my elderly MIL.

Then it hit me, there was another option... I stormed out the room, aggressively laced up my new Brooks Ghost 12's and just left. I got out into the street, shaking and crying, and just started running. 14.2km and 1hr 9min later and I was calm. Angry, but calm.

It's now the next morning, my ankles and calves are a little achey, but other than that I'm fine.

Had I not gone on that run, it's likely I would have called every mutual acquaintance of this woman and told them what she's done and probably would've made myself out to be an utter psycho in the process. I also probably wouldn't have slept and would be sitting here in a migraine fog right now. Instead I've just sent out a group text and left it at that.

I've been running for roughly seven years (31F), but spent the first five of those running less than 15km a week and progressing veeeeery slowly. I'm a mild asthmatic and my cardio fitness was abominable. Didn't have a watch or use an app, just mapped things out and kept up walking/running until I could run 5k. Two years ago I decided I'd plateaued for long enough and decided to shoot for 10k which I achieved shortly (1h06 pr). Got myself a watch and finally started paying attention to my progress, incorporating fartlek, long runs, etc. I still have never run in a race though as I was deadset against that originally for some reason.

Various stresses and health issues meant that my progress halted soon after that. I didn't run very much from then until now and took a four month break during quarantine for various reasons. I started back to it again in late June, and at the beginning of August I decided I was sick of being so slow and was going to take some serious measures.

So I upped my mileage gradually from 8k a week (I know, I was focussing on strength training) to 25k currently with an aim to be doing 30-35k regularly soon. 5 runs a week, incorporating slow recovery runs which I've never bothered with before. I expect to run a 10k this weekend for the first time in two and a half years, and today I finally broke a 30 minute 5k for possibly the first time - 28:52 to be exact. Also, it was during an unexpected crazy downpoar of rain haha. It was nowhere near as hard as I expected it to be, so I'll  be jumping straight into training for a sub-60min 10k and a sub-25min 5k! :D

Then life got busy and by Aug 2020 till now, I haven't been able to find that same motivation. I still run about one to two 5ks / averaging on three 3ks a week (my fitness routine isn't just running. There're other days when I'm busier where I do HIIT / strength training), but I no longer feel that same excitement I used to. I am also *much slower*.

Some days I plan to do 5k, but just end up doing 3k because I'm just kind of bored, or just decide to do strength training after instead.

I'm here to ask for some help, tips, tricks and everything in between that can help a girl out.  How do I start? Is there a plan I should follow? How do I set a good pace? Should I try preparing for a half marathon after several months of training just to push myself further? How do I stop myself from giving up when results don't show as fast as I was hoping for? How did some of you overcome the difficulties in the beginning?

I started and stopped jogging twice in the past year. It was mostly a combination of several factors, such as a busy work schedule changing abruptly, being sick, and just losing motivation soon after. So, here I am, asking for some basics that can help me start and stick to it. The most prevalent reason I want to start running, besides improving my both mental and physical health, is that I had to move back to my home country, to my small hometown, and back in with my parents once the pandemic hit. It made my life make a 180-degree turn, I've been catching myself lately being lethargic, unmotivated, and slowly creeping back to the depressed state I've been in before I moved away.  I think, and really hope, that running will also change my mindset and overall approach to day to day life since I can't really make any long term plans. Everything I had planned for this year crashed and burned miserably once COVID came out to play.  I want to make another 180-degree turn, but this time on my terms. I'm struggling with a pretty devastating relationship, a mundane office job, and the grim reality of living in a small town without many things to do and a lot of my friends not being here anymore.

3713,3713,3713,22,This Feels right,1599042302,"Hi guys (and girls)

Usually I don't post anything in this subreddit, I lurk in the background upvoting your posts but today I felt the need contribute my journey.

I started running towards the end of July, reason being is that I was going through a period of having my nose blocked everyday and I was beginning to get uncomfortable with the amount of empty nasal spray bottles in my dustbin.

Now to put matters into context, I'm 26 years of age, male, turning 27 in October. The idea of constantly consuming medication scares me especially at my age. I'm no child but I'm certainly not a senior citizen so there's no reason for it seeing as how I have no pre-existing medical condition and I've been relatively healthy my whole life leading up to now.

The global pandemic only added to my anxiety so I started suspecting I might have coronavirus but instead of going to the doctor, I got out of bed, put on my sneakers and went for a run. I had no intended distance in mind at the time, I just wanted run till either I was too tired to continue or till my nostrils started opening up.

After 20 minutes on the trail I started breathing heavily, there was an obvious discomfort in my chest and I could feel my calves catching fire 😫. I relented, turned back and started to walk back home. At this point my nose was wide opened and I could breathe properly, as soon as I caught my breath I started to jog again but at a slower pace.

When I got home I was drenched in sweat and exhausted in a manner I was no longer familiar with... The funny thing is, I felt great at the same time! The ruminating thoughts that added to my anxiety were silent after my run, I could barely stand afterwards but my mood felt so great! 

I promised myself I'd go for another run the following day, and I did. I promised to do the same the following day and once again I followed through until I had ran every day for a full month.

Looking back now. I'm so grateful I decided to get out of bed that morning over a month ago. I think about running every day now and it's the first thing I do when I step out of bed. Anyway I'm beginning to ramble now 😅

At this point I had been to a dr to a physical therapist up through trial and error we found orthotics for my flat feet that took away shin pain.  I also did pt exercises for months .  However some exercises bothered my ankles and turned into tendonitis on the top tendons if my feet and in ankles. It’s never been really bad but just there 50% of time.

Unfortunately my high stress job and exercise being an outlet meant I just couldn’t not go on walk a 15 min walk.

At one point I could go on 1 hour walk and not have it bother me but after moving for thr last time I’m back to 15 mins walk would bother it and anything like a squat that requires those top tendons for balance would irritate it too.

I have been running for about 6 months now and think I am ready to add one interval run per week to help with my overall speed and endurance.

I have not quite hit a half marathon distance yet, but should get there this month with my current progress.  


My average pace on my short runs is typically in the low 8:00/mile mark and runs periodically getting around 7:45/mile. Long runs typically hover in the low-to-mid 8:00/mile mark.  


Does anyone have any recommendations for where to start with my intervals? I had originally plotted out a 10 minute warm up, 100m fast / 2 min recovery x 6, 10 minute cool down, but these intervals seem to be a bit on the shorter side. Is this a good starting point for someone who wants to add an interval workout once a week?

3757,3757,3757,69,Purpose of easy/ super slow runs?,1599003932,"Hi guys!

I’m a novice runner, started after quarantine began in March. I’m 26F, BMI 20 and I managed to improve from running 4K at 7-8min per km and dying to running 10km in an hour! Recently I started doing a half marathon training plan that will gradually build my endurance and pace over time. The first run said to run ‘easy’ for 40-45 min, keeping my HR between 120-170.

I hit my max HR of 190ish in all my runs. I’m able to hold it for 5-10km but my HR is always hovering around 188-192 especially as the run progresses. Today, in order to run and keep my HR &lt;170, I ran at 8:15/km for 5km. It was actually so slow and I didn’t even feel like I exercised, although I admit I enjoyed the run a lot more than usual! 

My question is, is there a purpose to running this slow? I understand it’s supposed to be an easy run, but is this too easy slash should I push my time more? Also, will I build endurance and improve by incorporating these easy runs with tempo and fast runs?

Posted a few times here and love your advice.

I have been a runner about 6 months, novice beginner. Went from 0 to running 30/40km per week for about 2-3 month. Did my first half marathon around the street on the wind and rain in 2:06 on first attempt and was pleased.

Unfortunately after that had a couple injury’s, piriformis/sciatic pain in the upper glute/thigh and a recurring ankle injury/pain around 6 weeks after falling a few feet out of a tree while having a laugh drunk.

Since these injury’s gone from doing 30-40km a week comfortably at 5:30-5:45km/per minute pace to now struggling to finish 7km’s at a leisurely 6:00km+/per minute pace. 

I feel like my actual stamina as well as the odd niggling pain has really  affected me.

Any tips on getting back into the groove? As runs have gone from being exciting and exhilarating exercises where I’m making progress to feeling like I’m so behind where I was.

Anyway, I've done three more 5ks since then and I am having a really frustrating issue. I understand the runners trots are quite common, but mine will last all day. I'll have terrible cramps all day, genuinely feel unwell, and need to keep pooping for most of the day.

When I first started running, it would just be like ""incoming!"" after a run and nothing else. Now I really seem to be suffering.

Tried a 5k today, and only managed 3.5k due to massive painful cramps, headache and severe dizziness.

I've been running ever since the gym is closed (was into basketball before) and yesterday, my left knee felt stiff (to be precise: there were a few steps where my left+right of the outside of my left knee felt tight, almost like ""locked"") for the first time ever after a 7k run. 

I did a hot-cold bath (I do this post-run before shower) against both knees and it helps to reduce what I think was inflammation. As hours go by during the day, I felt that my left knee was not 100%; there's something odd about it, especially when I went up/down the stairs. No sharp pain, but just sore, discomfort, and tightness. This morning, the sensation/issue is still there, although milder than yesterday. 

My running regimen/training was as follows:

* April + May 2020: ran total 5k with 4 stops =&gt; walk 100-200 meters (not 5k continuously)
* June 2020: 5k non-stop (yay!) 3 days a week
* June - August 2020: still running 3 days a week increase by 0.5k every 3 weeks =&gt; hit 7k last week. 

Additional info: 

* I bike (workout, easy-to-med intensity with short hill) on the non-running days
* I'm about 3-5 kg above my recommended weight per BMI (still decreasing on a slower pace) 

Pre-Workout + Recovery:

* I stretches for 20 minutes prior to run or bike
* I do foam-rolling every night of the running's day and occasionally on the day I bike

I have never hard any issue with running until I increased my run to 7k; after 6.5k, I think my knee starts to feel stiffer. I ran 7k twice and noticed that my knee started to ""whisper"" to me. My 3rd 7k run is where my knee issue becomes noticeable.

I've been training for half-marathon (not a real event) for the past 3 months and this Saturday is the big day. The problem is...

Anyway, with all this being said, what option would you all choose?

1. Run one day earlier (Friday) and not have a full taper + might be a bit more tired since Thursday is a long work day. BUT it won't be as hot and heat plays a big role in how well I run.
2. Run on the planned date (Saturday) and in really hot weather. But will have a full taper and may not be as drained from the following work day.

They found that people finishing in/around 3 hrs tended to log nearly twice the weekly mileage as those finishing in/around 5 hrs. 

But this got me to wondering.  Those finishing in 3 hrs are obviously faster than those finishing in 5 hrs but are they doing the extra miles because they're faster or are they faster because they're doing more miles?  For example, if a 3 hr person and a 5 hr person went and ran for an hour, the 3 hr person will obviously cover more ground.  The 5 hr person will need to run 1.5x as many hours in order to get the same mileage.  Or is it a little of both?

so my next move is to run 9 km under 6 min/km. Im just wondering if there is any limitations that i should be aware of. For example can i do as i did before and run 9 km every run until i hit my goal or should i wait x days before i run it again. Maybe do a shorter run inbetween?

I ran my first half-marathon last September and finished in 2:03. My goal for this year was to do sub 2, with a stretch goal of sub1:50. I started the Runner's Weekly 12-week sub 2 hour plan back in June. This included a mix of interval, threshold and long runs. 

Last weekend I ran a [half-marathon TT](https://www.strava.com/activities/3987802591) and achieved my goal of sub 2 hours: 1:53:45, 8:41/mile, 162 avg. HR. At the end I felt fatigued, but I think I had a little more left in the tank. I've seen plenty of numerical advice on pacing (i.e. 10k time x 2 + 10 mins; 10k pace + 20-30 secs). But I haven't been able to find much advice on how I should **feel** at various stages of the race.

For the first couple of miles I was paying close attention to pace so as not to start out too hot. After mile 3 I stopped paying attention to pace as much and started to speed up a bit. I felt really good through mile 8, no fatigue or discomfort. Half way through mile 9 I had to run up a short steep ramp on a dirt trail. This was the first time I really noticed the fatigue in my legs. Beginning around mile 10 I started to notice a dull burning in my legs. They felt a little bit heavier. But I was still able to speed up. This burning continued to increase through to the end, but if you look at my splits I continued speeding up. My last three splits were 8:29, 8:20, 7:59.

HR zones https://imgur.com/gallery/702aZEO

https://imgur.com/gallery/x2EUzqn

To explain the graph, the first 5-10 minutes is where I did a walking warm up (subtracting the walk from the total time means I did the 5k in approximately 40+ min. The walking pace was normal speed, like walking to a mailbox. I wasnt in a hurry at all and you can see my HR is 100+ as I start to run. I then used the following intervals to cover 5k: 60 seconds running, 30 seconds walking. It is important to note that my pace during the running portion is deliberately slow; that pace where any slower and you'll feel silly like you're just bouncing up and down and can walk faster. I'm going to estimate it at about 12+minutes/mile. 

As seen in the chart, after the very first 60 second run interval, I'm already in zone 5, above 167 bpm. Less than half way through the run, my HR is reaching 190 and continues to reach higher at each interval, peaking at 199 BPM at the final intervals. 

I am using a Garmin Forerunner watch, paired with a Garmin HRM chest strap. I've been using them for a few months already through various activities and get consistent readings for my activities. I say this to rule out the idea of a faulty reading on the day I did this 5k.

After a little research I bought an app called WorkOutDoors for iOS/Apple Watch. It allows creating for intervals, which I intend to program with the Strava training plan, but had some questions for the more seasoned folks here.

Strava uses McMillan Running and links to their training calculator. I plugged in some data and it spit out some goal times. My first interval training is coming up tomorrow and I'm trying to understand how this works. The workout reads as follows: ***include 12-16 x 400 meters at Speed Pace, 3 minute recovery jog between each repetition; include a warm-up and cool-down***. According to McMillan my 400m pace should be 5:41. Some questions:  


1. I think I figured how to program the interval in WorkOutDoors but it calls for Target Slowest and Target Fastest. Am I understanding correctly that's upper and lower limit for how fast I should be running my pace? Should my target fastest be 5:41? What about my slowest?
2. It seems that manually inputting Strava training plans into the WorkOutDoors app will take some time and effort. For future reference was there an easier way to do this?

3847,3847,3847,62,I'm curious to see/know your favourite scenic running routes,1598953030,"First-time caller long-time lurker here, hi!

I wanted to know if you have any memorable/regular scenic running routes that any of you have ever done, or if there's any you've encountered on your travels. Pictures, descriptive text, maps links, whichever you prefer, but I'd love to know what some of you have encountered while running and why they're important to you.

Reason why I'm curious is I'm inspired by a run I did last month while backpacking (happy I packed trail shoes!). It was in the Austrian Alps around Lake Fuschl, a 6.8 mile/11km, 615ft./187m elevation, part gravel/part dirt trail which looped around this beautiful blue lake.

What made it different from other runs for me (other than the immense scenery) were the amazing smells in the forest, the complete silence, and the various happy people I encountered along the run. Uphill lung-rippers along the trail were rewarded by rolling downhills to claw your time back. Felt it was a perfectly balanced run from a cardio/legs perspective while also having some of the most amazing and beautiful views I've ever encountered.

[I've uploaded a few pics here (if you're interested)](https://imgur.com/a/EMnDexD), as well as the stats from my run. 

Looking forward to seeing what others have to share! I want to compile a list, map layer if possible.

As a kid I was never athletic. I was the kid who could barely muster five push-ups, and could barely run far enough to complete the mile requirement in high school. I didn’t think it was a huge deal- plenty of people weren’t in shape so I didn’t need to be either.

Then I went off to college and realized how wrong I was. I struggled to get from class to class on time. While all my friends were out (pre COVID) playing games, I was at home because I was too afraid to go outside in fear I’d embarrass myself. I hated my freshman year and was excited to return home and see my friends.

Thing is, my friends from highschool had all gone and made themselves better people- both physically and mentally. I was the only one who looked about the same and had a deteriorating mental state. It broke me even further.

A few days after that realization hit, I was sitting in bed thinking about how I’ll never make it like they did. And I can’t tell you exactly what, but I’m my mind I just told myself “I’m running tomorrow”. Where? How long? Didn’t know, didn’t care. Just knew I was going.

So I hoped in my car and drove to the local trail. It was july, so not too hot yet where I’m from. I didn’t set a timer, but I set a distance- 3.1 miles. A 5k. And I ran and ran and kept running until my legs hurt, and then I ran until I couldn’t feel them anymore. I ran from everything. I ran from the expectations and the failed reality, I just ran. I left everything behind at the start and just kept going. 

When I finally finished, I wasn’t nearly as unhappy as I had when I started my run. I came back realizing that I can be who I want to be, I just gotta train and push myself. Everyday after that day I was on that trail (and eventually had to break cause I hurt myself).

A few days ago, I ran my first 10k and I have never been happier in my life. I gave up caffeine and soda completely, I stopped having such negative thoughts, I’m more awake and aware, and I’m starting to like the way I look in the mirror now.

The moral of the story is, if you’re in a position that I was in and you just happen to stumble past this, keep going. If you’re hurting and don’t know if you can keep going, dig your heel in and let your legs burn.

3859,3859,3859,75,Ran first half marathon today. Have a few questions on where to go from here.,1598929711,"OK so on a whim I decided to ditch my normal hill runs and try to see how far I could push myself (previous max distance was 8.5 miles.) I ended up doing an out and back at a half marathon distance because I felt so well. Everything was going swimmingly until around Mile 10 when I fell off the face of earth. I was able to push through the last few miles and am overall elated. 

Here are my stats. 13.6 miles total, 2:20:18 total time elapsed, 10:18 avg per mile.

1. I was closer to 9:30 until the last 3 or so miles. What should I work on to increase pace? I did get a bit tipsy the night prior and didn't eat the best meal so I'm sure just by preparing better I can shave off 15-30 seconds a mile right off the bat. 

2. Joints started to hurt around mile 8 or so. The last time I attempted such a long distance I started to hurt around mile 6 or so. Could this possibly be due to poor form as I get tired?

3. How long after such a large distance is it recommended to rest? Currently I'm averaging 20-25 miles a week depending on how I'm feeling.

3863,3863,3863,79,Fat Joggers Unite! - Tips &amp; Advice for your fellow obese 'jogger'.,1598925027,"I haven't read any similar posts asking about detailed information on this, so here it goes. Hoping this will help other fat lurkers out there looking through the ""fit, runner's world"" window as well.

**Background.**

I have recently taken on getting into shape after letting myself go over the years. I am severely overweight and can barely jog at slow pace for a minute straight. I've genuinely enjoyed my time eating chips on the couch. However, I'm in dire need of more energy, a better lifestyle, and frankly, not having to worry about the higher risk of collapsing after climbing up a couple flights of stairs.   


**What I've done, and what I plan to do.** 

tl;dr I started off building up walking at increasingly aggressive paces and distances over the past few weeks. I am now giving a 5k program a shot, and largely walking/fat-man jogging most of the time. I have absolutely no shame severely struggling out there, even when most of the community around me is filled with skilled runners on the trails. I'm doing my thing, and taking it one step at a time. I've noticed the aches and pains associated with running is exponential when you're as large as I am, and when all 300lbs+ are pounding away at the asphalt. I realized my lifestyle New Balances were probably not cutting it. So, I've just pulled the trigger on some highly reviewed Saucony balanced sneakers to hopefully ease some of those pains.   


**Questions.**  
**1)** What practical recommendations do you have for me? As mentioned before, I'm not really in need of motivation here, but more so tips and techniques you may have for your fellow fat-jogger.   
I know for a fact that my form isn't great, and it gets sloppier as I get fatigued (really quickly), so I open myself up to injury. This is one area I'm concerned about. I'm also interested in what other's fat loss journey has been, especially those who were once obese. What mistakes can I avoid? How can I ensure I actually stick to this and not give up? Lastly, I'm sure the benefits of running far outweigh the increased impact on the joints over the long term, but this is another area I'm concerned about, as my knees/joints are pretty weak. 

**2)** This one sounds like a simple inter-webs search, but I've seriously been struggling trying to find something good - what do other fat-runners recommend for clothing? The sizes for run wear is tailored to the more slim profile, of course, and it's really difficult finding decent dry wick gear for fat people. Any advice is appreciated here. I'm particularly interested in long sleeve and short sleeve t-shirts.

A few studies have found that CO2 levels as low as 1400ppm start to impair cognitive function; therefore, with this in mind, does anyone think athletes in the near future are at a severe disadvantage? Perhaps runners in the 60s had a huge cardio advantage over today's athletes?

I chose this race because I wanted to try something shorter for my first race. I started running this year and only just started running 4-6 times a week like two months ago. I usually run 3-8km each run and I also started training with HRM with chest strap. I also have quite a bit of cycling in last 6 years but running is totally new for me.

Anyway there was this local race which had 3,7 and 8,4km course. I signed for the shorter one and was thinking that I would keep my HR around 160-165 (28yo). Well that didn't really work as well as I expected. When we were waiting for the start and the countdown started I felt rush of adrenaline and my HR was already at 140. 

As soon as everyone started running I realized that there are only two options 

A: Keep HR in a reasonable range and let everyone run away or 

B: Just see for how long I can keep up with everyone and hope I will not get heart attack or something. 

After first few hundred meters I was already at 190 and there was just no way I could keep this up for the rest of the race, but to my surprise I did and set my new PRs in that race. I checked my HRM during the race a few times and even saw 205 there once. 

There were just 5 of us running the short race and about 50 people on the long one but it felt good to keep pace with them for a while. 

I never even realized it would be possible to keep this pace but being in the race kept me going even after I thought I would not be able to run. It was amazing feeling when I went through the finish line and realized that this was probably the hardest 16 minutes of my life (at least physicaly). I also realized that there will be way more of those efforst because I wanted to be even faster on my next race. I think I just became obsessed with improving myself.

3919,3919,3919,40,"Requiem for a Race, lap 1: The Dipsea Race [x-post from r/artc]",1598898204,"Hey folks -- over on r/artc I was chatting with a bunch of folks about how we all had Big Races and Big Plans that all got blown away by Big Problems in the world over the last few months. I decided to start a little series for people to talk about their big race -- what makes it special, how they were training for it, and what they hope to do next.  This is the first one, and it's about my favorite race in the world.  I thought it might be of interest to some of the folks over here too.

## The Dipsea Race

People who have been around this sub in its various incarnations for a while are probably aware of my love for The Dipsea. Run every June, it is a truly unique race: Overly simplified, it’s an approximately seven-mile trail run from downtown Mill Valley, California to the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach.  But that leaves out the history of the race, and the handicapping, and the shortcuts, and all of the crazy stories that have grown up over the years around the race and its runners.

Let’s start with the basics: If you look at [a map and elevation profile of the trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/2437424221), you’ll see that it starts and ends near sea level and   crosses over two major ridges along the way.  It turns out that in 1904, a couple of runners from San Francisco were vacationing in Stinson Beach and took a day-trip to Mill Valley — which had only recently become possible thanks to a new rail line — and made a bet as to who could get back to their inn on the beach, on foot, the fastest.  They raced (the winner is still in dispute to this day), and a tradition was born.  The next year in 1905, the “Dipsea Indians” (as they named their group, an offshoot of the San Francisco Olympic Club) organized the first official Dipsea Race and the rest has been history.

## The Handicaps

Early on, race organizers decided that they wanted to give anyone a shot at winning the race.  Every runner was given an individual “handicap time”, and those times were even published in the local newspaper before the race.  As the field grew, it became impractical to know the abilities of each individual entrant and the race moved to a handicapping system based off of age and gender.

Only men aged 19-30 (the “fastest” demographic, or “scratch” runners) start at the official start time. Everyone else gets a head start, with the slowest groups starting 25 minutes before the scratch runners.  Under this system, an 8-year-old girl won in 2010 and a 72-year-old man won in 2012.  In any given year, you’ll find 60-somethings and 20-somethings duking it out over the last mile of the course.

Your official time for the race is based off the start time for the scratch runners — so if you run the course in an hour, but you start ten minutes early, you have an official time of 50 minutes. 

## The Stairs

The race starts in downtown Mill Valley but less than a mile up the road you reach the base of the first of three sets of stairs, about 685 total steps, that have you climbing out of Mill Valley.  On any given day you’ll find all sorts of folks hiking or running up or down (or up _and_ down) these stairs, but on race day this is the first bottleneck you’re likely to hit.  Bottlenecks and choke points on the route are a recurring problem that needs to be avoided, outrun, or simply accepted -- hey, sub-threshold rest! -- but they're also where the speedsters will get vocal with cries of ""Stay to the right!"" and ""Passing on the left!""

Later on in the race, runners have to contend with the Steep Ravine steps, this time barreling down steep, twisty, unevenly-placed railroad-tie steps as they simultaneously try to avoid twisting an ankle and diving into the ravine.  Plenty of injuries occur on these steps each year, but faster (and more confident) runners are able to make up tons of time by taking these steps two-, three-, or even four-at-a-time in spots.

## The Shortcuts

For years after its inception, Dipsea was an “open course” race — it was up to racers to determine their best route to Stinson Beach, with the consensus route along the Dipsea Trail serving as a suggestion rather than a mandate.  In the 1970s, restrictions started to be begrudgingly added, and now there are essentially three main shortcuts: 

* “Suicide”: A short scramble down a steep, slippery, dirt-and-gravel hillside that only cuts off about 90 yards of the consensus route
* “The Swoop”: A longer descent down a rutted, vegetation-choked hillside that eliminates about a quarter-mile and one of the most beautiful parts of the trail; but who has time for beauty on race day?
* “The Panoramic Shortcuts”, a series of narrow singletracks that have runners jumping on and off of Highway 1 as it switches back up away from the beach towards the end of the race

This isn’t to say that this is the extent of the short-cutting going on, it’s just that most of the rest of the shortcuts are closely-guarded secrets. If a shortcut has a significant impact on the race results — like one did in 1983, when Ron Rahmer had a strong finish after pioneering a novel route between Mill Valley and Steep Ravine — the new routes are typically quickly regulated out of existence.

## Registration

I saved this for last, because it’s a pain.  Intentionally.

The race itself is limited to 1500 athletes, and the organizers are not shy about wanting to preserve the “local” feel of this historic race.  There are a few ways to get in:

* If you ran the race the previous year and did well enough, you are invited to run the next year
* If you have a convincing enough sob story and/or make a large enough donation to the Dipsea Foundation (an organization that both maintains the trail and also provides scholarships for local students), you can buy your way in.  On the website, they say “YES, we do take bribes!”
* Or you can apply by mail for one of the remaining spots after the invited runners and bribers

If you’re in the last group, the race is on once Dipsea posts the year’s application to their website. They take applicants into the race on a first-come, first-served basis, as determined by when the applications arrive in their post office box at the Mill Valley post office. For a long time local runners have hand-delivered applications to mailing centers to try to earn their spot – first at the Mill Valley Post Office, later to the local USPS sorting center, where I found myself on a lunch break on Application Day in 2017 handing in my first Dipsea registration. 

## My 2020 plan

The Dipsea always comes at something of an odd time in my race calendar, but it remains one of my A-races every year.  I’m a triathlete by nature, but trail running has always been one of my endurance-sport loves; in February I was getting out on dirt and hills at least once a week to prepare.

The plan was to stick to trails at least twice a month, and try to get at least 600 feet in each of those runs.  As I got closer to the race, I was going to spend more time on hill sprints and  mixing in some stair climbs.  I also wanted to get out to Stinson Beach and spend some time working the Steep Ravine descent - knowing exactly how to place my foot each step of the way down that section of trail is one of my long-term goals.  It’s a hefty drive for me, though (90-120 minutes each way, depending on traffic), so I hadn’t actually planned it out completely up to that point.

I had vague plans for a number of specific workouts for Dipsea:

* Two-minute hill sprints at &gt;10% grade, repeated 5-8x
* Tempo runs at 5-8% gradient
* (New for me this year!) _Downhill_ sprints at a -10% grade; I get the impression this is somewhat dangerous, but becoming better at downhilling seems to be the key that will unlock significant improvements in my time — I don’t think I’m particularly slow descending, but I know there’s still a lot of room for improvement there.

This was the general shape of the plan that I came up with during my offseason; these workouts would have to find their way into a schedule that was also trying to prep me for a number of important multisport races along the way.  I work with a coach, and we spent more than a little time discussing these goals and how to try to prioritize and achieve all of them.  I'd be curious to hear if anyone has good recs for steep trail workouts.

On March 13th, the race organization announced that they’d be canceling the race (for the first time since 1945.)  It was the first of my major races for the summer to be canceled, but it wasn’t the last.  Right now, I’m pinning my hopes on the rescheduled Duathlon National Championships to still take place in October, but otherwise I’m just looking forward to next year.

## What’s next

I’m waiting to see what happens with Du Nats in October, and once the results there are definitive (either the race gets canceled, or I actually participate in it) I’m going to look again at what I want to do in February through June of next year for this race.  My entry for this year is supposed to carry over to next year, so I hope to toe the line at the Mill Valley Depot on June 13, 2021.

## Training

I finished my first half marathon last year (Chicago Half Marathon) in 2:03. I did much better than I thought I would and ever since then I was excited to try to beat 2 hours. My goal for this year was sub 2 hours, with a stretch goal of sub 1:50. Earlier in the year I signed up for two half-marathons both of which were cancelled unfortunately. So I decided to do a half marathon TT on my own. 

I began the Runners World 12 week sub-2 hour half marathon plan back in June. The plan consisted of a mix of interval training, fartlek, threshold runs and long runs.

## Pre-race

I woke up at 5 AM to have breakfast. I had a bagel with peanut butter and coffee. I filled up my water and race nutrition. I used a handheld soft-sided water bottle with plain water (12oz). In addition, I had a belt/bottle that I filled with Hammer Nutrition's Perpetuem (16oz). I did a mile warmup at around 6:15 AM. I started just around 6:30 AM.

## Race

The temperature when I started was in the low 60s F, perfect temperature for running! I didn't want to start out too hot, so I took it easy for the first few miles. I naturally tend to speed up over the course of race so I had to watch my pace closely. After several miles I was feeling good so I stopped paying attention to my pace and started to speed up a bit. Overall the first 9-10 miles felt really good. My breathing was comfortable and my legs felt good. 

The first time I really noticed fatigue in my legs was in the 9th mile. I had to run up a short steep ramp on a dirt trail. I really felt that short intense effort! I finished my energy drink by around miles 10. At this point I really started to notice the fatigue in my legs. I would describe it as a dull burning. This sensation increased through to the end. The hardest miles were 11 and 12. The burning in my legs was starting to get uncomfortable, but I couldn't ""see"" the finish line yet. Once I got to the final mile my legs were burning, but I could visualize the finish ahead of me so I was able to dig a little deeper and speed up. Managed to measure the route perfectly so I finished right in front of my house.

## Post-race

After I finished I walked for a bit to cool down. Then I went inside to shower off and grab second breakfast. After that I relaxed for a few hours while watching the Tour de France (I consider myself more of a cyclist, but I've started to love running too!). I'm already starting to plan for my next attempt on 9/20. I think I can beat my stretch goal of sub 1:50.

I've been lifting weights semi regularly for a while now but only took up running in April after a complete absence of cardio for years. I was absolutely terrible when I started out: my first run was 1km and it took me an hour to recover... After a couple of months I managed to hit my goal of a 25 minute 5k which was a massive struggle but delighted to have hit the milestone.

However, I haven't progressed at all since then as I've been taking things quite easy: I've been going for 15-16 minute 3ks a couple of times a week with the odd 26-27 minute 5k sprinkled in when I feel good.

The thing is, I still feel so unfit. I start breathing quite heavily after 1km and am pretty shattered after 3km. I want to become fitter and now want to set myself the goal of ultimately running a 10k, so I'm wondering how best to approach it. 

I always feel knackered after 3k/15 minutes ish and any subsequent kms are a battle, so I'm wondering whether it could be a good idea to split up a longer run into segments and resting a few minutes in between. For example, 3 segments of 2km with a two rest periods of 5 min ish in between.

I am wondering if you have advice on how to improve my recovery time from longer runs, and or whether there are some hard and fast rules. 

I am male, 37, 5'7 and weigh 169 lbs. I am fairly athletic, but could still stand to loose a few pounds. I generally run 4-5 times per week, a couple on the treadmill during HIIT workouts, a couple 4-5 km runs w/ hills, and usually a longer one on Sundays (10-16 km w/ the occasional half). My 15 km plus pace is usually around 5:30/km, and my 5km pace is just under 5:00/km. I'm no Mo Farah.

The days after my longer runs by body feels like it needs a rest, especially around the hips / glutes. At the same time, I see folks I see out running all the time on Strava, and they are crushing longer distances all the time, day in and day out. Mentally I am there (and really want to do more, its saving my mental health during the pandemic), but clearly need to improve my recovery routine. 

I know we are not meant to seek medical advice, so more asking what has worked for you. The web brings up things I do, like stretching, sleep, and foam rolling. I know this. 

Is the answer that everyone is different, or these folks are just better conditioned? Or are there other things you good folks of Reddit would recommend to assist with recovery so I can get back our sooner, and go harder.

I try to regulate mood with self care, running and meditation. I’ve been running casually since I was 23 and have completed two marathons and half a dozen half marathons. I used to be able to run 3x 5-7km during the week and then. 10-16km at the weekend without even thinking about it. Recently however (last 2 years) I’ve found running tougher.

For a variety of reasons, I’ve now decided to stop the pill.

I've really enjoyed getting into running over the past couple years, and I've really stepped up my game during COVID. But my god, this was a horrible surprise.

So apparently, if you have an especially intense or long-distance run, your bladder slaps around inside of you resulting in blood in your urine?! A way to prevent this is to run with a slightly fuller bladder. That is something I distinctly try to avoid.

So now, I can't run for 72 hours / until the blood clears up. I'm hoping it's a minor issue and doesn't require a doctor's visit. I'm reading that sometimes the damage can be more severe.

Everybody was so supportive of my running goal and fundraiser that I was able to raise $410 in 30 days!

### Training
I am a 24 yo male and have started running in the beginning of the year. Took march, april and may off because I was hoping Covid-19 would be over soon and I would be able to resume training normally (lol). Came back in the end of may and started Hal Higdon’s Novice 2 half marathon plan. It was a really good training program, started slow and easy and gradually built up the mileage throughput the 12 weeks. I had never run farther than 10 km before this plan and, in this month alone, i ran 15 km, 17 km, 19 km and 21 km. In the middle of my journey I hit a road block where I would just stop running before I was tired or hurt. I just could not finish a workout, no matter how short it was. It went on for about a week and I made a post here at reddit that really helped me. I got back on track and crushed all my sessions after I finally overcame this mental block. Really happy with my overall progress as I did not skip a single workout. The only thing I would change is I think I should have accepted sooner that running slower in training is the way to go. You just have got to do it to get fitter and faster. 

### Race strategy
I was fairly confident that I could finish the race, as I had done 19 km 2 weeks ago, so I decided to set a time limit goal. I used an online pace calculator that, based on my 10 km recent time, said I should run at about 5:14 min/km. Thus, my goal was set on finishing below 1:50:00. Decided to have a sip of water at 5 km and  15 km, q sip of gatorade at 10 and 18 km and a GU gel at 7 and 14 kms. 

### Pre-race
Nothing major. Had a big pasta lunch and a few cookies an hour before racing. Made sure that I drunk lots of water throughout the day and that was pretty much it.

### Race
I took it fairly slow after a couple warm up kms and just got into a comfortable pace for the biggest part of it. Felt really good up until about 10 km when a pain in my right hamstring pooped up. I had never felt this before and immediately I thought I was done. Pushed through it and luckily after about 3 kms, the pain was gone. Just cruised through the race up until 18 km when I realized I felt much better than anticipated for this point in the race. Decided to pick up the pace and kinda flew (for my standards at least) towards the finish line. I even had my fastest pace at the last km (4:33 is close to my 5 km race pace lol). 

### Post-race
Amazing feeling of pure joy and accomplishment. Both my parents are hal-marathoners and I never could fathom how they could run so fast. I was fit, but never imagined I could do it. I was just ecstatic that I got it and beat all my goals. Besides that, got a few blisters at my pinkies and my big toe, but nothing major lol. Also, didn’t really fell that tired, could probably go another 10 km if I didn’t accelerate towards the end.

### What's next?
I have been bit by the endurance bug, not going to lie. I hope to keep doing this for the rest of my life. Love this sport, how it makes me feel and what it makes me think I can do. I graduate from college next year and that is a pretty popular track competition for medicine students in my area. Hope to compete in the 6 km and, maybe, in the 800m. To win the 6 km I need to hit about a 3:45 min/km pace, so that is a goal for about a year from now. For the immediate future, I think I’ll get on another half marathon program and try to crush 1:45:00. Above all else, I just want to keep running, keep getting better and keep believing in myself.

First off, sorry if this question doesn't fit here, but seemed like a good spot to ask. 

I'm looking for a watch recommendations to replace my Fenix 6 Sapphire/Ti. I paid almost $900 for it last winter, but I realized it does far too much for what I need. The past month the sensors have been acting up, HR freezes and doesn't work, steps don't count, compass doesn't work, etc. I have been in touch with garmin support, but they haven't been able to fix the problem and might RMA the watch, though they haven't responded to me in weeks. Needless to say I'm very upset with garmin and this insanely expensive watch.

What I do:
I tend to run both on pavement and trail. I do a lot of indoor biking on peloton. I also do some light weights and body weight exercise. I have a Polar H9 for when I want accurate HR.

Features I prefer to have:
Good 24/7 HR
Accurate sleep tracking
Easy to use app or program to load sessions on and read from
Durable watch that looks good

What I am debating on:
Polar Grit x for the good HR, sleep metrics, and Polar Flow
Coros Apex or Apex Pro for the watch durability, good HR and easy app.

4018,4018,4018,40,"Hills, Humidity, Humiliation",1598822930,"Hey guys, first time poster here.

I’ve been running for nearly 4 years now. I used to do frequent 5ks a week and was even training for my first race before it was canceled from covid. I recently moved home after being abroad for school and had to take a break from running (not the first time I’ve had to do it; I won’t say I’m on/off with running but a few times a year things come up where I have to take a week or so off). I’m usually good about gradually getting back into it whenever I do take some time off, but this time I’m having trouble with patience and the will to do it. 

I recently moved home and forgot about 1) hills 2) humidity and 3) combined how they make the perfect storm for pain.  I moved home early August and between moving counties, finishing grad school, starting a new job (in the education field nonetheless), having to quarantine for two weeks, and navigating culture shock, it’s safe to say I’ve been under a lot of stress.  We all know how great running is for our mental health, so I was excited to start getting back into it after my quarantine, thesis submission, and paperwork was submitted for this job. But as I’m trying to get over the mental barriers I’m struggling with the hills and humidity of where I live.  Any tips or advice? How do you guys handle the mental blocks like frustration? How do you reframe any negative thoughts that can arise? How to be kind to yourself while you’re easing back into it? Is there an art to running in this type of climate? I recently moved from Northern Europe where the heat wasn’t an issue and although there were hills I felt I could conquer those no problem, but now I’m struggling to do 2 miles.

I'm maybe around 30 meters behind her and she runs right past these two women, who seemed like they were college-aged. As Beth runs past them, one of the girls begins mocking aforementioned stride—**literally**. Her friend starts giggling and joins in on mocking said stride. 

**Here's the ""funny"" bit:** as I'm running past them, at a clearly slower pace than Beth who's passed me, I can overhear them saying something along the lines of: ""See? That's how an athlete should run!""

4054,4054,4054,76,Novice Runner: Is it Normal to Run A LOT Slower in 80+ Degree Weather?,1598809327,"Hi All,

I'm a relatively novice runner and had a question about running in the heat. I'm out west and am working with east coast teams, which means I start my day by 5:30 or 6 AM and don't have time to do morning workouts like I normally do. I typically have been running between 4 and 6 PM, which is usually the hottest part of the day during the summer.

I've been doing Couch to 5K and was able to generally complete my runs easily even when it was warm. However, the last couple of weeks when it's running for 25 mins straight, I've noticed I can't even complete the workout anymore even though I used to breeze through them. Additionally, I noticed during my weekend run when I can wake up early and run that 25 minutes was an easy run for me.

After failing on my runs twice this week, I decided to go all-in and run a 5k straight this morning to see if I'm somehow getting less fit, since I have been working later than normal the past few weeks + increased stress in general. I'm happy to report that I was able to complete my 5k within 24 minutes pretty easily. Since the only variable that has changed is heat, I'm wondering if it really makes so much of a difference that I can go from easily running a 5K within 25 minutes to barely being able to run 2 miles at the same pace without taking a breather?",running,showmetheEBITDA,False,/r/running/comments/ijguwa/novice_runner_is_it_normal_to_run_a_lot_slower_in/

4056,4056,4056,78,10 tips for a beginner from a beginner,1598807513,"Hey all, I see running tips and tricks for beginners on this sub all the time, but the advice always seem to come from intermediate and advanced runners. While I greatly value a better runner's opinion... sometimes it just isn't helpful for me because I am not in the same position as them.  

Some background on me: In college, I got very fat and to lose weight, I started running. ""Started running"" turned in running a half marathon, which then turned into running a full marathon. After the full, I quit cold turkey and I gained back every last ounce of the weight I lost. 

Fast forward to today: I'm in the best shape of my life and I'm training for a half marathon again. It has been 6 years since I last ran any kind of significant distance and I've been slowly working my way back to becoming a distance runner. 

So, though I have ran long races, it's been a long time, and I'm back to being a beginner. Here's some advice from a beginner to another beginner 

1) Have a goal in mind for why you're running and make sure it's a goal that you want to smash. ""I want to be healthy"" isn't a strong goal. You'll run half a mile and give up if that that's the case. My goals are currently to break a 2:30 half and to lose 20 more pounds. Those goals are keeping me motivated to go out and finish my runs. 

2) Do not worry about your pace right now. You will never love running if you're constantly beating yourself up because you can't run a 7 min mile. It will come with time and training. Starting at a 15 min mile is perfectly okay and expected! 

3) Wear what makes you comfy. I'm sorry, but I got chubby thighs and I'm not wearing shorts to run. Chub rub is real and hurts like hell. 

4) Ladies, spend the extra money on a good sports bra. I personally love Shefit. 

5) If you run more than a 5k a week, BUY GOOD SHOES. Seriously, do not wear crappy running shoes. 

6) Get a music playlist or podcast that you only let yourself listen to when you go for a run. I started with podcasts and now that I'm trying to up my time, I switched to music (140-160bpm list). Now when I really want to hear a certain song, I gotta go for a run. 

7) Find a path that you feel comfortable running and has milestones that will keep you motivated. I always do my 5-6 mile runs on a wooded trail near my house. I know that the playground is the 3 mile mark and the hill of death is 5 miles. It seriously helps when I'm feeling tired because then I see the playground and know I'm halfway done. 

8) If you're running more than 30 minutes, bring a carby snack to replenish your energy stores. Bananas are my fav cuz I can throw the peel in the grass (make sure the sticker is off!) 

9) Make a running Instagram or send your running pics to some friends who will hype you up. Nothing is more motivating than a few people who tell you how awesome you are 

10) Running. Is. Hard. Start super small. Go for a quarter mile run once a week, then slowly up your distance until you get to a mile. Do not worry about your pace. You will get faster, but it takes time.

&amp;#x200B;

With the temperature finally starting to drop after a few very hot months, I decided to attempt my second half marathon on Monday. My first 21k run was about a month and a half ago. This time, I actually ran further, and finished 25k in 2:26:02.

&amp;#x200B;

Then on Wednesday I went on what was supposed to be a 5k recovery run with my flatmate. We finished the first 5k with a 5:32 avg pace, but I was feeling good so I kept going for 5 more k. Finished 10.34k in 51:36, and the last 5k smashed my previous 5k PR, with a total time of 22:43.

&amp;#x200B;

It was not over yet. Went on my last run on Friday, not planning to attempt any new PRs, but once again, I was feeling great, and smashed my 10k and new 5k PRs within the same run. Finished the total 10k in 45:20, and set my new 5k PR with 20:36. I had never ran at this speed for such an extended period! I'm excited to be this close to 5k under 20.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't expecting at all to beat my previous PRs by such a big difference, but I'm really glad I went on all those shitty runs under the heat during the past month. Feels like coming out of that high gravity chamber where Goku trained.

### Background &amp; Training

As is probably true for many of you reading this, 2020's sucked for me pretty hard. In addition to the global pandemic affecting us all, my city (Chicago)'s been dealing with police brutality and its resulting civic unrest, and also hosted an unwelcome tornado a few weeks ago. On top of all that, personally I've been dealing with a pandemic breakup and being diagnosed with HPV (baby's first STI). It's been a fun time, and by fun I mean absolutely terrible. So when I read about [this challenge on r/advanced running](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ibgxol/6121824_challenge_experience/) I thought, why the hell not? I'll see how doable something dumb like this is for someone of my age, gender, and general stormcloud temperament, and have something to think about for a little while that isn't simply the crushing despair of being alive.

Before the pandemic came to the U.S., I was training for a spring marathon using a modified Hanson plan (longer long runs), hoping to get under 4 hours after a 4:04 attempt last fall (which itself had improved upon a previous 4:31 best). Since that race was cancelled in March, I've mostly repeated the week of the training plan I was in when I got the news. It includes one interval day (usually 12x400m), one should-be-tempo day (that I've mostly run easy instead because \*gestures to world\*), a long run of 16-20 miles, and two easy 7-8 milers, which all shakes out to 60-65 miles/week. Every 4th week, I do a step back and go down to about 30 miles instead.

To prepare for this particular effort, I abstained from masturbating after Friday 8/21, and resumed eating a dessert every day (which isn't unusual for me, but I'd stopped doing because of sadness-induced appetite loss after the breakup). Running-wise, I cut down my Wednesday-Friday runs by a mile or two. ([Supplies ready a week ahead of time](https://imgur.com/VOTbIL6))

### Targets

I don't consider myself a fast runner even under ideal conditions. I've also learned that, for me, sub-9:00/mile paces require a zest for life I no longer possess. So I didn't really care about paces or time targets for this challenge, although I thought it would be nice to accomplish these goals between waking up and going to sleep that night.

So for those who didn't visit the link above to learn what the 6/12/18/24 challenge (aka the Multiples of six challenge) is all about, it's to assign each of those numbers, however you choose, to the following list of activities and then try to accomplish everything within a 24 hour period (less if you can):

* Running a mile
* Masturbating to orgasm
* Eating a donut
* Drinking a beer (note: I subbed hard seltzer because beer is ugh)

It was clear from the get-go that I was going to run 24 miles and eat 18 donuts, but I decided to give myself day-of flexibility on the other two assignments. I'm not a big drinker. The last time I had alcohol prior to this challenge was the day of my breakup, where I chugged a bottle of wine and then spent hours weeping on the public way before eventually vomiting multiple times in my home. But my previous orgasm record in a day was 4, and it didn't seem like a great time to give myself any more sexual aversions than I already have. So I just decided to go by feel that day and see how it went.

### Route

I planned to split the run portion of the challenge into 3 segments: 1 18-mile run that follows my standard long run route, and 2 3-mile runs.

The lakefront is the go-to running trail here, but since it was closed earlier in quarantine I've gotten used to doing my long runs on the North Branch trail (and trails that connect to it). One of those variants takes me by an ex's house right around the 9-mile midpoint, and I arranged to use their porch as a contactless aid station. I didn't pre-plan the 3-mile runs because, who cares, they're 3 milers (no offense intended to anyone for whom that is a substantial distance, I'm just used to longer routes).

### ""Race"" report

#### Session 1

Wake up to my alarm at 4:30am. My hope for some sexy dreams had not come to fruition, but I start the stopwatch on my phone and think of England anyway, making sure to use a very light touch. I come three times before getting out of bed to eat 2 chocolate donuts and drink a ruby red grapefruit white claw (a balanced breakfast).

I put a cherry bon viv into my handheld water bottle and top it up with water, put another donut in a sandwich bag to take along, then hit the road at 5:50am with Spotify's Guilty Pleasures playlist in my ears. ([Setting out](https://imgur.com/7QFN3HV))

##### Miles 1-9.3 (First 15k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3981595537)

I immediately run into trouble with the seltzer’s carbonation in my water bottle. Shaking the bottle as I ran was creating enough pressure to make the seltzer/water mix shoot out of the bite valve every couple minutes. To prevent this, I have to drink enough of it so it has room to foam, which immediately makes me feel a little queasy, but I continue on at an easy pace, burping all the way.

At mile 3.1/5k I encounter a guy on a bike stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, hunched over and swaying slightly like he was trying hard to stay upright. I feel sympathy for him and hope he isn't a harbinger of what this adventure will bring me, but keep on. (In a big city, you mind your own business unless someone is visibly bleeding or actually asks for help.)

Miles 3.5-7 are blissfully free of incidents and most thoughts. The North branch, Saganaush, and Skokie valley trails are all pretty sparsely populated at this time. I don't get runner's high, but sometimes my thinking pauses for a bit as I run, and the break is fabulous.

At mile 7.3 I pull the donut out of my flipbelt and find that it has been crushed into crumbs that, because the donut is chocolate frosted, bear an uncanny resemblance to dog poop. I avoid eye contact with passing cyclists as I eat it anyway, and am glad that my aid station donuts were plain and powdered. ([Chocolate on my face](https://imgur.com/M2XDn64))

My aid station at mile 9.3 is left outside for me in a cooler: a lime white claw, two plain donuts, and one powdered. The lime flavor is ok, and I pour it into my handheld bottle and continue on.

##### Miles 9.3-18.6 (2nd 15k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3982126156)

At the aid station, I realized I needed to pee, which wasn't part of the deal but something I should have anticipated due to drinking more than usual on the run.

I end up using a portable toilet on the Channel/Sculpture trail, mentally screaming inside about both covid risk and general port-o-potty foulness the whole time. When I pull my shorts down, they are completely soaked in sweat. I promise myself to stop using my hands to wipe sweat off my face, and not to drink from my bottle spout anymore because *it could have touched something in there*.

Less than 15 minutes later, my concerns have faded and I'm drinking and sweating just like before. I vaguely remember again when I eat the donuts, and make sure to not to touch the donuts with my hands as I eat them out of their bag.

I get home, eat 3 more chocolate donuts and drink a cup of water because the donuts feel SO DRY in my mouth. I open a can of each of the seltzer flavors I haven't tried yet and put them back in the fridge, hoping they'll go a little flatter and thus become more palatable. I drink another cup of sweet, sweet water.

Realizing this is probably as sober as I'm going to be until this is all over, I masturbate again and come 3 more times, my ears ringing afterward. I take a mango bon viv into the shower with me, and the more of it I drink, the worse it tastes. I want more water so much that I imagine opening my mouth under the showerhead, not really caring that the water's warm.

[Session 1 video recap](https://imgur.com/U5eL4Pk)


#### Session 2

I eat 3 more chocolate donuts and drink another glorious cup of water, then head out for another run.

I try to speed up this run because it's hot and bright out, and because I don't want to put sunscreen on. I listen to a custom playlist of mine that I've titled ""Speed demon"" (speed's all relative) and the run itself is pretty uneventful. ([Warm tho](https://imgur.com/JQla3Fc))

I get home and drink more water, and notice chafing from my earlier run when sweat drips onto areas of my body that it turns out are raw. I'm running out of hooks to hang all my wet clothes on at this point.
I try another masturbation session, come two times but have trouble with #3. I get there eventually with patience and an extremely taboo mental scenario, then celebrate with several more donuts. I realize I've lost count of the donuts I've eaten at this point, and have to count the ones that are left intead. I start drinking a raspberry white claw, which is maybe an ok flavor and maybe just better because it's flatter. At this point I am starting to reconsider all my life choices that led me here, but the end seems so close. I finish the seltzer and take a nap.

#### Session 3

##### Miles 21.7-24.8 (5k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3983575624)

The end's in sight. I put on fresh running clothes for the last 3 miles (5k) and Spotify's Throwback Workout playlist on shuffle. All my muscles stiffened up during my sublime nap, but they begin to loosen back up after the first mile. I follow the shade and avoid humans, and soon my mileage is complete. ([Smile 'cause it happened, smile 'cause it will be done soon](https://imgur.com/FAk8KEv))

When I get home I drink another cup of magnificent water then wrap up the donut goal too, finishing with one powdered and one plain donut. I never even touched the packs of mini donuts. Turns out one of them expired in June.

I chug another half cup of water just because I desperately want it, then set upon the final two goals. Feeling uninspired for self-love, I check out the passionx subreddit (which I used to like), but everything I see on the front page disgusts me now. I return to my imagination, thinking of a less taboo scenario but in far more detail than I'm used to, and come twice more. I try a bit for #3 (aka #12) when my hand cramps up, so I head to the shower along with a cherry white claw.

The showerhead makes me come for the last time, and the feeling is no longer pleasant, but it is done so the satisfaction comes from that. Still in the shower, I open the stopwatch app on my phone as I choke the last drink down, finishing the seltzer and the challenge in 11:00:11.56.

#### Totals
24.8 miles (40km), 18 donuts, 12 orgasms, 6 alcohols

### Lessons Learned

This is dumb, don't do it. But if you do, keep carbonation in mind, and be prepared to complement your own life goals outside of the challenge as much as you can. If I'd had 12 drinks, I would've gotten drunk and sick, and likely have caused myself some social embarrassment by getting all sloppy and sad about my solitude. Instead, after this exhausting run of self-debauchery I am disgusted by the idea of touching myself again, let alone wanting anyone else to touch me. *Perfect* for an isolated single person during a pandemic.

Next week's another ""scheduled"" stepback running week, so I can use my extra running recovery time to also recover from the varied forms of self-abuse I engaged in as part of this challenge. I'm currently only 1.8 miles away from 2020 miles run in 2020, so reaching that milestone will be nice.

### Kudos

Many thanks go to my support team. I've stopped talking to all my real friends as a result of my in-progress emotional breakdown, but in their place I have assembled a patchwork configuration of ad-hoc support that I think of, in a Blanche DuBois-channeling way, as ""the kindness of strangers."" I appreciated the help of these exes and tinder chat buddies (while acknowledging that they are obviously humoring me for their own selfish reasons), including:

* The ex who let me use their porch as an aid station
* The tinder bae who, after hearing how I was discouraged by the trauma-causing ex, said ""Why are you trying to assemble a support team anyway? The original guy didn't mention any of that""
* The ex who, when I became disheartened about attempting this due to the trauma-causing ex expressing disapproval and refusing to help, said ""[Eff] him""
* The tinder bae who assured me that I don't need ""validation from an overkill challenge"" but also offered to ""fight [their] way through whatever configuration"" with me if I wanted a partner. (looool... Reader, obviously I did not)

Here comes my running history: In April 2019 I changed my chip and started running to loss weight  because I wasn't feeling healthy with my body. Few months later, with lots of suffer, diet (not the healthiest one) and being so strict with myself I managed to loss 30 kg. I started running progressively until I felt I could run 5k straight with a standard pace (5:30 ~ 6:30). Then I stick to 8 km with a pace improvement (5:00 ~ 5:30). All along this time I was ""motivated"" with the weight loss journey. But since the beginning of the year I started to feel like running was a task to do and not an activity to enjoy, like a punishment for overeating one day, for example. During the pandemic I totally stopped running and started overating, ending up in gaining 10 kg. I told myself to stop that path and when running was allowed again I went to do some runs, but not with the pace I had before and without the consistency of going running every other day. In summer I was kind of more consistent but from the very begining I don't really enjoy or look forward to go for a run, just on some hype days, but that's it. Also I noticed that I start running with a higher pace than the pace I finish a run with. I'm thinking on changing the routine or my way of understanding running. But I want to feel joy hitting the ground with the shoes, and not take it as a responsibility but to create a consistent habit to keep myself fit. Now, I don't overeat, and I think I'm following a balance diet even though one day per week my brain goes crazy and lets myself take a cheat meal day. But as said, I'm really concern about running as I WANT to enjoy it, to look forward to do it.

* **What?** Salming RunningWorks Bibra Lake Running Festival Half Marathon (Perth, Australia)
* **When?** August 30, 2020
* **How far?** Half Marathon

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |&lt; 5min/km pace | *Yes* |
| B |PB (1:46:30) | *Yes* |
| C |Don't die | *Yes* |

Perth is currently free of community transmission of COVID, so we are lucky enough to have had almost all our restrictions eased. So, yes, this is an actual race with actual other people! I’d decided at the end of last year while recovering from a foot blister the size of my nose (I am not kidding, PM for pictures) that I wanted to do more races in 2020. As you can imagine, that idea has been going... not well :(

This is to my knowledge the first race in the city since lockdown ended.

### Training
I run around 45km/week, with a bare minimum of 40km (weather and life permitting). I’ve been consistent since February, except I missed a week a month ago due to an injury from stretching at my desk at work, of all things (getting old sucks; I don’t recommend it). My long runs are usually 16-17k. Last year, before the aforementioned blister, I was doing much the same. During lockdown I was doing up to 55km/week, but since returning to work I’ve had to bring my numbers back down. I PB’d 12k in May at the same location (55:16) on the date of a cancelled fun run.

 This race sort of rushed up on me, so I didn’t do much specific for it – I just changed a couple of runs to tempo and changed a long run to fartleks in the weeks before, and then tapered with a tempo 7k and a couple of slow 10s. But it is a super flat course, so I knew that, goal of doing more races or not, if ever there was a race to try to smash, this was it.

### Race strategy
This was my first race over 12k, so I didn't really know what to do, I just knew I didn't want to fail my goal. So my baseline strategy was very conservative - go evenly around 5min/km and then see how much I can push the last 5. I had also decided beforehand though that it was okay to do a 1km fartlek every 3-4km in order to catch up any lost time, but only if I was running over and feeling okay. But that plan turned out to be terrible, so I threw it out after 2km.

I’ve tried a few nutrition approaches, but lack of availability of my favourite – a particular type of fruit mince pies only available at Christmas – meant that for this I settled on the old standby of snake jelly candies. I went for Natural Confection Company, for those Australians reading ;) Honestly, for a race I'd probably just do the same again next time, but I still prefer the fruit mince for a solo run.

### Pre-race
I got up at 5 and started my morning with a cup of green tea and a large cinnamon twist. Hydrated a lot, stretched a little at home, and drove to the lake for an 8am start. It was a little chilly, but the sun was out, so I found a sunny spot to stretch and keep warm. I chatted to a few random people but none were around my pace; there were pacers for the marathon event, but not the half (despite the half being by far the largest event), so there was no way to see who was going to be around my target pace. I listened to the safety brief, dashed off for a last-minute slash, and got back just in time for the countdown!

Incidentally, I saw the pacers on the course, obviously, and there was one guy using the 3 hour pacer, and that's it. Kind of a waste of effort having them, really.

The course is almost exactly a 6km loop run anti-clockwise on a two lane dual use cyclepath around the lake, so the first 1.55 is run clockwise, and then you're back on the loop proper to get back to the start, and then three laps of the lake. I had kinda assumed it would be three laps and then some extra, so this was actually going to mess with my nutrition and water plans a little, but I wasn't too worried about that. 

### Kilometers 1 to 5
At the go, we all started shuffling and moving. The ""out"" part the out and back had a lot of traffic to pass; the field was a little slower than I expected, and I found myself ducking and weaving a lot, and using the opposite lane when I could do so without dodging marathoners coming in the opposite direction. My first km was in the 4:30s.

By the turnaround I'd settled into a group of three others - an older guy, and what I thought were a couple. The older guy said he was aiming for 1:45, so I knew I was in the right group. He identified another guy further ahead - a taller older guy - and said that he had the same aim but was a little faster. We were soon joined by a fifth, a young, tall bald guy. Together the five of us ran in the low 4:50s - faster than my plan, but I was happy to have a pacing group. But then the older guy took the lead for the fifth kilometer, and took us to a 4:59, and we were overtaken by a strong looking guy from behind us. This wasn't enough for the tall guy or the guy from the couple, and they slowly got away from us.

Splits: 4:36, 4:55, 4:51, 4:44, 4:58

### Kilometers 6 to 12
After the 4:59 I was feeling pretty good, and I was also feeling held back by our pace leader, so halfway through the 6th I decided to go ahead as well. I was already almost a minute ahead of my goal, so I could afford to try a faster pace for a bit, and still recover if I couldn't hold it. If the group came with me, cool, but I didn't want to risk dropping below 5:00 yet. The guys that had left our group were still ahead, but within 200m or so. But I soon left the group behind. Heading up to the start area to start my second lap (9k) I swallowed a couple of snake jelly candies, which I washed down with a few swallows of electrolytes from a lovely volunteer. For most of this period it was just me, with my faster former groupmates not far ahead, overtaking marathoners (and being overtaken by marathon leaders). This probably suited me better than a pace group anyway, as it gave me the benefits of group motivation, but I could still be a little flexible with my pace. I took electrolytes at the 12k, and I was feeling pretty good, so despite already being well on track for finishing my A goal, I decided to push a little more and see if I could catch the guys ahead. This also happened to be a good time to push for a negative split, but of course I didn't realise that because Running Brain was not capable of that kind of coherence at that point.

Splits: 4:49, 4:54, 4:50, 4:51, 4:50, 4:54, 4:50, 4:45

### Kilometers 13 to 17
I couldn't catch them. Despite my soft kick, they remained tantalisingly ahead. I took two more snakes and water at the 15: One lap to go! I glanced at my watch. I already knew I was well ahead of my planned pace, but I could see that 1:41 was achievable. I was thinking about that when, suddenly, as we rounded a few corners... were they delayed by traffic? I found myself definitely closer to the guys in front. And then closer again. I reckon I can definitely get them!

Splits: 4:48, 4:42, 4:47, 4:45, 4:39

### Kilometers 18 to 21.1
Turn after turn, I got closer. I passed a guy with a sloshing water backpack who had come past earlier. I passed the old guy's tall mate. I passed the guy from the couple. I passed the tall guy, and the strong looking guy! I got them all! And then, disaster. At the start of the last kilometer, a stitch came on hard and fast. I changed up my breathing to manage it, and it quickly subsided, but the pace drop - and their own kicks - was enough for the tall guy and strong guy to whip past me through the final turns.

Splits: 4:39, 4:41, 4:34, 4:42

### Post-race
I took my medal, and found a sunny spot of grass to collapse on. I ate a snake or two, and after a few minutes I got up and wandered off to find a park bench to stretch on. When I got home, I sat in my car in the car port for half an hour staring into space, enjoying my numb post-effort brain. Then I lined up some friends to meet me at a burger place for lunch. I needed food. And a shower. Shower first.

It's a pretty massive PB, but all my other halfs have just been training runs. Every fast attempt I've done has been 1:46 or worse, which is a testament to how a super flat course and even a small amount of atmosphere and having other runners on the course can add a huge amount to your time. Also a lot of things came together for this to go so well. I accidentally ran a textbook negative split, pretty well perfectly paced in terms of efficiency. I'm still not sure how I did it, or that I could do it again!

Chip time/new PB: 1:40:39

4098,4098,4098,22,Distance Running Diet,1598763765,"I have a few questions in regards to nutrition while training for a marathon. I have been running consistently (~15-20miles per week) for several months and have started to work towards a marathon now. In the past I was always good about tracking what I ate for both weight purposes and making sure I wasn’t underrating for my running.

For the past two weeks or so as my distances have been getting longer I’ve been having a harder time controlling what I eat. (Ex. Today I did a 10 mile long run and ate ~4500 calories instead of the ~3000 that I know I needed) The majority of what I eat is healthy and isn’t the problem I don’t think. Does anybody have a good way to prevent this (meal timing, what I eat, frequency, etc)?

I also have a slight problem where I would like to cut my weight back down to 150lbs instead of 156lbs. I’m 5’9” and overall felt like I was at an ideal weight for my height and body type having been both heavier and lighter in the past. The only problem with this is that I have been maintaining (roughly) my weight because I’m afraid that under-fueling after working it will keep me from recovering quickly after longer runs. I know I need to be in a deficit to lose weight but don’t know if it’s smart to do so.

In case it’s any help in answering my schedule is roughly 2 days of medium distance higher intensity, 2 days of shorter less intense workouts, (In the near future I’m hoping replace the low intensity with higher intensity, but that’s more of a schedule conflict) 1 day of cross training, 1 long run , and one rest day per week.

I’m a long distance trail runner and have ran a couple marathons before and am currently training for a 50k.

I signed up last minute for a local night trail half marathon just because it sounded like fun and the race was tonight. First and foremost, it was a blast! But I also set a new PR and broke a personal goal of a sub-2 hour half: 1:58:37. I was super stoked about this because the trail was slightly technical and had a decent amount of elevation (~750 feet). I remember running my first half marathon (as a training run) with a much much slower time thinking that I’d never get faster.

\* \*\*What?\*\* 220 Days Sober Marathon  
\* \*\*When?\*\* 08/29/2020  
\* \*\*How far?\*\* 26.2 miles

\### Goals  
| Goal | Description | Completed? |  
|------|-------------|------------|  
| A |Run a marathon | \*Yes\* |  
| B |&lt; 5 hours | \*Yes\* | 

I know that race reports aren't particularly thrilling when they aren't, you know, *real* races, but given that there are no live marathons happening around here anytime soon, I figured I would indulge in sharing the story of my first marathon. I'm not a huge fan of races in general; I ran the Philly Half-Marathon last autumn and found the whole experience very stressful and claustrophobic. I will probably never run a real race again. Anyway...

It's call the 220 Days Sober Marathon, although it was supposed to be the 7-months Sober Marathon, originally scheduled for last Saturday. However, a minor injury had me push it back a day (becoming the 7-months-and-One-Day Marathon), but I was then derailed by a fast and furious bout of depression. Only 5-miles into that try I ended up asleep on a park bench.

Luckily I was able to shake it off after only a few days and picked up my training again. I was only scheduled for 18 miles on today's long-run, but two steps in I knew today was the day.

\### Training

I have been working with a running coach since January-ish. Health issues - including a month-long impatient stay to deal with my bipolar disorder and alcohol addiction, and a breast reduction in April - slowed things down considerably. But since I recovered from my surgery in May I've been mostly full-steam ahead. Losing a bunch of weight from the surgery and religious CICO tracking also really helped step up my running game.

My training schedule is pretty standard. I slowly got up to 40/50 miles a week. Monday is rest day. Wednesday is workout day (various intervals) and occasionally I dabble in doing double run days.  I think I realized that I don't love tapering in prep for big runs. I need a pretty steady weekly running schedule (not just number of runs, but total miles too) to help keep my moods stable.

Having a coach is wonderful and I think the best way to stay motivated and accountable. He has been incredibly supportive and inspirational, funny and frustrating, and steady rock in my life while I've been navigating some hard ups-and-downs these past few months. Sobriety's not easy! And if he's lurking and reading this, I hope he knows that not only would I not be running marathons without him, I would absolutely not be alive today.

\### Pre-race

Big bowl of oatmeal with nuts, fruit, and peanut butter, and two cups of coffee. 

\### Race

Turned my watch on (Coros Apex), started my running playlist (instead of my 25 hour audiobook on Winston Churchill), took two steps, and knew I was feeling good.

At 2 miles a steady rain started and didn't stop until mile 22. It was glorious. For some reason the rain lessened the affect of the headwind (my biggest running foe), and the waterlogged shoes just masked the little pains of blisters forming. I loved jumping around puddles and alternating my pretty standard, straight, and flat route due to flooding streets and sidewalks. But most importantly, there was no one out! Usually saturday long runs cause me a bit of mental anguish....not because of the distance, but because I live in an area where everyone is out and about on a nice saturday. Not only do I have to play frogger a bit, but I also spend a lot of time feeling shitty about myself watching beautiful fit people prance around while I'm slogging through my long run. I know it's pathetic and I should ignore other people, but it's a major drain on my mental health and self-esteem. But not today! It was just me and a few other runners splashing through the rain.

Mile 20 hit me pretty hard and I took a pause/walk for a quick snack. That got my through mile 23, but man those last 3 were tough. My body was just going and my mind was doing all it could to ignore the fatigue. I wish I had one more snack with me; a burst of sugar would have made all the difference for that last 5k.

\### Post-Race

Pizza and ice cream, obvs! 

My feet don't look terrible for being soaking wet for 24 miles. After an hour or so of aches and pains, I'm feeling A-OK right now. Looking forward to a 3-mile shake out jog tomorrow morning.

\### What's next

Well, a 50k is only like 5 more miles, right? I just need more snacks. Something to aim for celebrating 9 months.

4130,4130,4130,55,Swollen abdomen during and after running,1598742207,"Hello everyone, :)

Curious if anyone experiences severe abdominal swelling during and after running, and, during any physical exertion. Many years ago while exercising (a bike ride), I felt something heavy in the area between my sternum and navel. It made physical efforts a bit harder and I could not belly breath as deeply because something felt ""in the way"" in that area. During this time my body weight increased by 15 pounds within a month with no changes to diet, sleep or exercise. Over the years, the swelling would get more pronounced, especially after every bowel movement and any amount of exercise, even 10 minutes. Body weight continued to gradually increase (have more overall puffiness rather than being lean like before). 

It has reached the point that I had to stop running because my abdomen would get swollen like a lady four to six months pregnant. I've had many labs and tests and everything came back normal. I ruled out it being food related because I experience the pregnant swelling no matter what foods I eat. I also experience the swelling even drinking water. I also don't eliminate as much water considering the amount I drink throughout the day. It feels like my body is retaining everything I drink rather than eliminating it like it did before the onset of these symptoms. 

It has been a mystery that many doctors I've seen over the years (medical and naturopathic) cannot find find a root cause for the extreme swelling after exercise and bowel movements.

Where to begin. 5 almost 6 months ago I started doing home office (due to... Yea). Before then I would walk to the office, walk stairs, move along during the day etc etc. I started gaining weight. Had one too many bears during the evenings and just generally stopped caring about myself. I gained around 15 pounds in 4 and a half months. 

Going back a month and a half was where I took the first step to getting back to real life and in shape again. Still having home office, but feeling MUCH better adapted and now know how to work efficiently enough and still be productive.

My first step in this tale is that I stopped drinking completely, I stopped with all the sweets/candy and just said fuck it, I can fucking do this.


Going back pretty much exactly a month I saw a reddit post about running and it got me intrigued. I started running and it felt good. It felt really good.

Coming from a background of a lot of sports when I was younger (Wrestling semi professionally, soccer, ice hockey, golf, everyring you can name I've probably done it) I felt extremely burnt out at the age of 21 (now 28) and went from being rather slim and fit to overweight. It's been a rough couple of years but I've finally taken my life back and started doing something about it.

So back to the running topic: I've now ran for around a month. I started off with a 3km run and had an average pase of 6 minute 54 per km. I am now up at 4km per session and today I did 5 minute 41 second per km. I've improved myself and my time by 1 minute and 13 seconds over the course of a month. Please note that I have a very good physice coming from a lot of sports from before. Please also note that I've not increased the time unless I felt like I could do it. The times I've done lately have felt really good and not at all exhausting to the point of me feeling like I wanna puke. I've felt exhausted of course but never more than that.

I just want to give a massive thank you to everyone on this subreddit for the tips and tricks you provide and to anyone who reads this messy post.

This is the best I've felt in years and it's mainly because of you all. Thank you so much.

About 5 days ago, I might have pulled a muscle in my back while running. My lower back felt a little stiff starting out, but then it felt like electricity when down the right side of my back. Ive been taking ibuprofen and RICE since then, and I've mostly been able to recover my range of motion, although twisting and laying down still hurts. I'm not thinking it's a slipped disc because of how quick I've recovered and how it didn't radiate into my legs, but I'm not 100% sure, since I wasn't lifting weights or doing an exercise that was really intensive on my back.

My question is, how should I go about working my way back up to running again and what should I do from here on out to prevent an injury like this? I always stretch and incorporate some flexibility warmups, but obviously that didn't work.

4165,4165,4165,90,"42km/w runner aiming for 60km/w. Experiencing persistent knee discomfort (just under kneecap). When is it serious, and what to do, without losing progress?",1598721871,"Hi there. As title says, I have been experiencing knee discomfort for the past couple of weeks, in my left knee. The pain feels like it is right under my knee cap, sometimes ""travelling"" upwards, and sometimes I feel it in my hip joint/flexor as well. 
I would describe it more as discomfort than pain. I can easily run through it, even for longer runs, where it doesn't intensify much. However, it is pretty constant, and I also feel it some days when I am not running. 

A short-ish overview of my running progress:
* Began running 3 years ago, and quickly (6 months ish) ran myself into an injury because I increased my distance much too quickly, and didn't know anything about running. Worth noting is perhaps that the injury was on the same knee as I am now experiencing discomfort in, and the first signs of injury back then (which I stupidly ran through and probably aggravated the problem) are similar to what I'm feeling now. 
* Stopped running, and only took it up again a little more than a year ago. From last summer and until late April this year, I was running quite casually, around 1-3 times a week, very very slowly building mileage but without any definite plan. 
* In late April this year, I was averaging around 18 km per week, and decided to get more serious about running, with a goal of reaching 60 km per week by the end of September. 
* **Running plan**: I have been increasing my weekly mileage every 3 weeks with roughly 10%. Until three weeks ago I was running 4 days a week, then went on to 5 days a week (with no increase in mileage for 3 week, only an extra day and shorter average runs).
* **Currently my week looks like this:** M: 0km / T: 8.5km / W: 4.5km / T: 0km / F: 8.5km / S: 4.5km / S: 16km 
* **Additional workouts**: Up until around 1-1.5 months ago, I was also doing additional strength training/bodybuilding in a gym 2-3 times a week, and yoga roughly 2 times a week. However, due to an increased workload and a lot of stress, I have not done much bodybuilding for at least 1 month, but still do my best to do yoga 1-2 times a week. I also bike around 5-10 km a couple of times a week (for transportation).
* I have been experiencing the discomfort for a couple of weeks (4 ish). I took a 6 day break from running last week, but the pain came back as soon as I got back to running. I should have increased my mileage by another 10% this week, but decided to stay on 42 km/w for now.

I feel like this time around I have been pretty vigilant about increasing my mileage slowly, building muscle and following a running plan made from information found on this sub (with regards to lengths of runs, frequency and increase). 

So down to my question(s): 
* Could the ""sudden"" pain come from stopping my bodybuilding workouts? Do you really lose all benefits from it within 4-6 weeks in regards to running?
* When should I be worried, in terms of intensity of the pain (as it currently isn't enough to seriously affect my running, but I am aware of it most of the time)? 
* Is there anything I can do to alleviate the discomfort/prevent it from getting worse, without affecting my steady progress towards my goal?",running,DarlingAurelia,False,/r/running/comments/iiwc9s/42kmw_runner_aiming_for_60kmw_experiencing/

\### Training  
A little about me.

\- Male, 39 years old, 5ft 10 (1.78m), 141 lbs (I've lost over a stone during training).

\- I ran cross country competively at school (ages 11 to 16) but hated track work.

\- I didn't run or participate in any physical sports or activity then until Oct 2015 - yes, 18 years later! I trained for the Sheffield half marathon (due in March 2016). Training went well for the 6 months but I pushed myself too hard which led to (what I think) were deficiencies (calories and vitamins) and the doctor saying he wanted me to stop training 2 weeks before the half marathon and pull out - gutted.

\- I lost heart and didn't run for 6 months, and from Sept 16 to Nov 18 I I did the odd run every few weeks - I had fallen out of love with running

\- From Dec 18 to March 2020 I didn't run at all - not 1 mile :-(.

\- Finally in March 2020 during lock down my non running wife showed an interest in the couch to 5k 10 week program which we both did. I bought her a new watch as a gift and a few weeks later I bought myself a Garmin 735xt and HR strap, upgrading from my reliable TomTom Runner. The Garmin programmes and new tech sparked interest, as well as some new trainers, and motivated me to pick up where I had left off in 2015/16. I have trained differently, more cleverly, by running by heart rate zones based on lactate threshold. I'm now at the end of and just completed a 16 week Garmin Connect 16 week training plan. I opted for the intermediate heart rate zone training planning. It was slow at first but my zone 2 lower ranges have picked up in pace and can now comfortably run at 7:30 min miles at a low heart rate.

\- I did a time trial on the 4th July (week 8 in the plan) as a tester and hit 40:22, and was so close to beating my target of 40 min 10km. 

\- I then ran on the 6th August 2020 on a track and achieved a 38:37 10km. 

For those interested in training schedules I have gone into depth for a usual day. I'm an early morning runner, alarm goes off at 6am everyday, get dressed, 400ml of water, nothing to eat, wee and poop (mandatory) and out the door by 6:15 without fail. I do not do warm up excercises, I start all my runs with easier paces and build into it. My weekly mileage ranges from 35 to 45 miles per week.

My weeks have been varied but roughly follow:

**Monday** \- an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6'ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I usually hit the trails for more hills and challenges, focussing on keeping my heart rate down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga. An afternon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.

**Tuesday** \- Interval training for 45 mins, intervals varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Wednesday** \- an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6'ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I keep this to road/pavement running with a few hills. + Adriene Post Run Yoga

**Thursday** \- rest day. I usally cross train with a mountain bike ride, pilates session or Hiit Tabata session from youtube. An afternoon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.

**Friday** \- Threshold/Hills/ or Tempo training for 45 mins, varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length, unless they are hills which I use trail woodlands. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Saturday -** My favourite day, easy heart rate zone 2 long run day. My exploration run, finding a 100% trail route and dissapearing into new trails for a couple of hours - I love following the little breadcrumb trail on my watch. The distance has increased through the program ranging from 8 miles to 16.5 miles, I covered the 16.5 miles in 2hr 17 mins at an easy heart rate zone pace. The recent weeks have mixed easy pace with faster race pace intervals. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Sunday** \- Rest day. A longer 45 min Adriene Yoga stretch session. I may do a family bike ride or walk.

**Training kit/ gear:**

\- Trail: Altra Lone Peak 4.0 (love these!)

\- Speed Sessions: Nike Flex Run 2015 or Asics Piranha SP4 (my fastest lightest shoe)

\- General Easy Run road shoe: New Balance Vazee Rush (now falling apart!)

\- Watch: Garmin 735xt

\- **Nutrition:** as above 400ml of water, unless its a long run of over 2 hours, I take a handful of gummy sweets and have 2 or 3 per mile (as a treat) and take one High5 energy gel at mile 4 or 5. I do not take water with me as the mornings are cool enough in the UK.

\### Pre-race  
My usual routine as above, however this time I ate 4 small midget gems (gummy sweets) before leaving the house and took 1 caffeine raspberry Hi5 Gel and a pot of gummy sweets in my running belt (I did not use any of these supplies on route). I wasn't planning on going for the target pace/time today as it was wet and very windy (30mph+ winds) so decided to wait until Monday 31st August when conditions looked more favourable. I didn't warm up today, just left the house and set off running at a steady tempo pace and went by feel

\### Race  
As I set off I averaged a steady tempo pace for the first 3 to 4 miles, battling the wet cold drizzle and heavy gusty winds - I considered turning around and going back to bed. However at mile 4 something clicked, I was warmed up and throughout the whole run the traffic and 'traffic light gods' where with me as every driver seemed to let me cross and crossing lights all worked in my favour. The usual hills were challenging but my pace was picking up from 7:30 to an average run pace of 07:00, so why stop I was at target pace almost! So I went for it from mile 6, knowing the majority of hills had been completed and I could make the most of the down hills. The section of down hills around mile 9  caused uncomfortable stitches for about a mile, so I focussed on breathing technique and it soon cleared. I think by mile 11 I knew I was so close to my 90 minute target, but the last return leg home to complete the loop had some killer hills but I was focusssed and came in at 90 mins 10 seconds, so very close! But hey I have a target for next time!

\### Post-race  
A big drink of water with electrolytes, a shower and a big oatmeal breakfast. A family walk today helped ease aching legs and a beer or 3 this afternoon has not been unappreciated!

\### What's next?  
Well I've finished the fantastic 16 week Garmin programme. I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend the heart rate training programmes, the thrill of seeing pace going up against the same heart rate is a real boost. Of course putting in the miles are key, so I will have a few easier weeks of easy pace running and then return to a similar schedule as detailed above. My next goal will be to secure a solid sub 90 min HM, perhaps an 85 minute will be the next target. I may also focus on getting my 5k time down through speed workouts.

4171,4171,4171,96,Back to back injuries has me down,1598717927,"Last weekend I had a back spasm that kept me on the couch for a few days. On Wednesday I felt good enough to get out and try a few miles, ended up going for 3 miles at a 7:40 pace. I was pretty psyched because that’s on the higher end of my pace spectrum. 

Early the next morning I woke up with a terrible calf cramp. The next day my calf was a bit sore but I was so pumped from my run the day before that I ran 4 miles during lunch break. The last mile of my run was brutally hard and my calf has been in constant pain ever since. In my mind the best case scenario is a week before I’m back in my joggers again, at worst it could be weeks.

I'm a regular runner (normally 12 miles/week with an additional half marathon/month but haven't done a half since April and can barely do 6 atm) and have been for ~4 years now but I'm having real difficulties with it this year. I put my back out in January driving long distances for work then March-May I was working from home with a chair that was giving me difficulties. It's all sorted now but I'm having to stop all running for a week or two every three weeks either because of neck pain, back pain or knee pain. I could just run through the pain (it's only mild now) but it don't want to cause any running problems further down the line so I just stop running when I get pain or niggles.

I've tried a neck/back massager from Amazon, deep heat/ibuprofen cream, baths, heat packs, I tried doing yoga everyday but now I do it an hour a week, I got new running shoes, have been using a knee brace, using RICE. My last gait analysis was last year and I was found to be neutral with no problems.

Was making decent progress then my calf started acting up and I didn’t want to seriously injure it so I decided to give it a break back in June. I started hiking instead. Long, slow hikes up and down hills and varied terrain. It’s become a great hobby and, incidentally, great training for staying in running shape. I made it a goal to at least take a 20-30 minute walk every day if I couldn’t get to a park. I have also been lurking on this sub the whole time and absorbing the important of going slow before going fast. 

Today I decided to try a 5k because an organization I support is hosting a virtual one. I was able to run/jog the entire thing without stopping to walk once. I paced myself carefully and kept telling myself to slow down (and also went fast when I felt like it!). Finished in 37:05. I’ve done this route before and I always used to have to stop and walk the hills, now they felt super manageable jogging then since I have been climbing literal mountains.

I’m not completely new to running however I am a rookie for long distance running. I started off running a 5k and a 10k weekly but have progressed to running a 10k and a 16-18k weekly.

It feels tight and when I start to jog is when it feels tightest. If I carry on running it’ll slowly fade away and I can run normally without any difficulty (except a slight pain in the knee below it but Im not sure if that has to do with anything?). 


I’ve always stretched after running and do a lot of yoga as a means to give my muscles a stretch and recover from other exercises I do, and I’ve tried to stretch where it hurts but it’s a really weird place to get to.

Ive been on a bit of a roller coaster with meds, with Dr office shut downs interrupting treatment. So it's been a long time since I've run. Meds are now built up and I've started running. For the first time in I guess my adult life my lung capacity is not a limiting factor, increasing from 2.5L to 4.5L.

So I go for a run, having just taken all my meds, including a beta2 agonist and steroid for long term treatment, plus albuterol (another beta2) as prescribed for exercise.

I felt great. No heart palpatations or usual thumping in my throat. No pain in my lungs and I ran a comfortable 30min 5km. I took two garmin with me: 645 Music + Vivo4 for oximeter.

Both recorded the same HR on different arms: 166avg, with a 195 steady average for the last 2km.

Is my heart just trying to catch up to increased lung capacity? I've never run with such a HR. Usually it's around 160 for this type of run, before treatment.

Since the pandemic I have taken up running by following the C25K routine but have thought that maybe long-distance running just isn't for me?,1598698474,"Ok, hear me out. I am young and relatively fit who's recently taken up running. I have made several attempts in the past to get into running but have failed due to several reasons: running too hard too early, not having proper shoes, not having time to actually run. I also have scoliosis, which I think is something I should mention. Anyway, naturally, my failed attempts at running made me HATE running. And it's tough because my boyfriend can run 10K non-stop under the hot sun and call it an ""easy mid-day run."" 

Fortunately, I found this sub and discovered the C25K routine. I decided that maybe this is the right time to take running seriously. I bought proper running shoes, and running shirts/shorts. I am now on my seventh week of the C25K routine and have really started to love running. It is the only time of the day when I get to just zone out and relax so in the past few weeks I've been looking forward to my next run on non-running days. 

Anyway, as some of you may know, the 7th week of C25K is the one where you do a brisk walk for 5 minutes and then run non-stop for 25 minutes. This has been really tough on me and have been stuck on this week for 3 weeks now. No matter how much stretching and massaging I do, the muscles at the side of my left calf seem to really, really tighten at around the 15 minute mark. Most of the time, I can persevere for the rest of the run without having to walk but at the end, I'd almost be limping because of how tight my calf muscles are. I say I'm stuck at this week because I don't want to move forward to the next week unless my calf muscles don't tighten in the middle of the run. 

As I have mentioned, I have done proper stretching and massaging in the particular part of my calf that tighten during the run. I'm also going to list some of the things I have tried to ""correct"" hoping the muscle wouldn't tighten too much anymore: 

* Asymmetric breath pattern
* Making sure that I land on my mid-sole
* Not running too hard by making sure that I breathe through my nose
* As mentioned, stretching and massaging

I am starting to think that maybe long-distance running (for me, at least, 5K is ""long-distance."" I know long-distance for some of you is like 20K or something!) just isn't for me! And maybe, I should just stick to walk-run intervals. However, I think that training for 5Ks, 10Ks, and marathons would allow me to take it more seriously just because I have a goal. Unlike when I do walk-intervals, where the goals might be a little more arbitrary?

4194,4194,4194,20,Lockdown Motivation,1598697357,"**Race Information**

 • Name: Lockdown Marathon

 • Date: August 28, 2020

 • Distance: Marathon

 • Location: Leicester, U.K.

 • Time: 4h 48m

**Goals**

Goal Description Completed? 

**A** Finish the Marathon? Yes!

**Training**

I used the Run With Hal, Novice 1 training plan. The time I had set to complete the marathon was far too optimistic. However the pace the training plan was getting me to run at was a comfortable pace for me, so I though I might manage it, until I saw the pace I had to run at for the Marathon. I gave myself 13weeks to go from a casual runner that had never gone over 15km to attempting this Marathon, i kind lost motivation a little over the 2 weeks before the Marathon as the training plan tapered off, but I’m glad it did. Over the training of plan I ran my first half marathon and then 4 more. 

**Pre-race**

In my longer runs in the past I had been really affected by temperature. I don’t have a clue how some of you in the US can run in 30+ degree heat (Celsius). There had been a bit of a storm over the UK at the start of the week and the weather for race day was looking wet and cold, which seemed ideal. Had a big dinner the night before and made plenty leftovers to eat the morning of the race as I would be running in the afternoon as I was working.

**Race**

It was a good afternoon for running, 16° Celsius and light rain. As I knew I wouldn’t be able to manage the time I set when I started training so I decide to take it very easy at the start and just try and find my zone. 

The route I had chosen to run was 2 loops of the half marathon loop I had used previously in my training, along a straight and level-ish cycle path that had been converted from and old railway line for about 7km, then along the river/canal in Leicester for 7km, the along the road back into the city for 6km to finish the loop. The section along the road was the most difficult with the elevation change, but on my second loop the rain started to get a lot heavier which made the section along the river a bit more slippery underfoot.

The first half went by pretty smoothly, I was remembering to drink, although this was not as vital as other runs as it was the coldest day we have had in a while, and it was raining. I was also pretty consistent with my energy gels having them in small mouthfuls and eating 1 gel over about 50mins. 

On my second loop that’s when I started to flag, by the time I was on the river section the rain was pretty heavy, and in just a vest I was starting to feel the cold. All along I didn’t have a time goal I wanted to achieve, I knew I just wanted to finish. This helped when I needed to walk as I was able to not worry about effecting my time and know that I would still be able to finish.

When I was close to the end of the second loop I realised I was going to be a few K’s short if I just headed home. So I took a turn to include one of the 5km routes I have ran before to make sure I arrived home bang on 42.2km. 

The last 10km was pretty brutal, it was really raining, getting dark and the wind had picked up. The energy gels didn’t feel like they were doing much, and I wasn’t moving fast enough to generate enough heat to keep me from feeling cold. 

When I ran into my estate to finish my girlfriend was standing out in the rain to video my coming in with a beer which was just the support I needed to finish. 

I can’t imagine what the feeling is like running past crowds of people cheering you on at an actual organised event. 

**Post-race**

I got back to my flat, tried to do some stretching but my legs were so sore I could barely move them. Got into a bath and stayed in there for a while to try and recover. My legs started to feel semi normal again so I made it to the couch were I sat eating pizza and watching a movie for the rest of the night, managed to get round to that beer about 4 hrs after finishing. I don’t know if it’s just me but the energy gels after a big run make me feel really full and almost a bit flu-y. 

**What's next?**

Not another marathon anytime soon that’s for sure. I’m looking forward to take some time off from running and get back out on my bike as it’s been sitting neglected all summer. But beyond that I want to focus on running faster, I want to focus on getting my 5km and 10km times down. 

I’ve been a follower of r/running for a while and I’ve picked up loads of good tips and tricks along the way. I’m never going to break any records and challenge in any races but hopefully some other people like me can see this and realise that with a bit of effort you really can do anything you set your mind to. If you had told me a year ago that I would have ran a marathon yesterday I would have thought you were insane. I think lockdown has been almost the perfect time for me to attempt this as I’ve not been commuting to work so I’ve been able to use that commute time for running. And it was really great to have my mind focused on something during this time.",running,lewis044,False,/r/running/comments/iiqb68/lockdown_motivation/

Started running (light jogging really) for 30 minutes at a time 3x a week two weeks ago and the cardio aspect is improving. I haven't been physically active for a long time though I'm only 120 lbs (M, 29). So I've been trying to take all the precautions to avoid injuries particularly with joints. So I'm paying a lot of attention to my body. Think I'm maintaining good form to the best of my knowledge from reading a lot of material here. Stretching 15 minutes after. On off days, I'm doing exercises to strengthen core, hamstrings, glutes, hip flexors etc. But I'm seeing slight discomfort or light pain here and there. Today, I'm feeling light pain right around or right below the right knee and also light pain in/around the right shin. Not that bad but I suspect something may be still off with the form because I read in a few form related threads to the effect of ""you should bend your knees, the more the better"". 

This cue I didn't really understand so I didn't pay too much attention to it. Can someone please elaborate what it means? I can't visualize that phrasing. Does that mean to keep the legs as NOT-straight through the movement as possible? I do take tight light steps by the way.

I'm working as a teacher, and home schooling and vacation was a bliss. But the schools are back to normal in Norway, and things are starting to thigten up now. Job as a teacher, secondary job as a sales leader, lifting two-three times a week and a weekly mileage goal of 45-50 miles = both mental and physical fatigue.

I was wondering; will one workout each week, plus one long run, and the rest easy, be sufficent to keep 'em gains coming? I know the answer to this question will be; it depends on a lot. So here is some info:

10k: 39:30

BTW2: I've came to the understanding that mileage is king. Maybe I'll be just as well of, gains wise, with one workout/week, and slowly increasing mileage, than with two workouts/week and no mileage progression?

First, I admire his passion for tuning and overall good spirit, but running everyday for 3 years and now that he’s injured he’s still trying to “keep the running streak alive?” For what? I’m sure he’ll be doing way better if he runs like a normal person with some rest days here and there. 

I’m kinda worried that instead of running for health, now his motivation is probably more like the pressure of “keeping the rubbing streak alive” at any cost by any means necessary especially since he got a sizable audience now. No idea if anyone in that audience is sensible enough to offer sensible advice about the importance of rest for recovery and progress and preventing injury, or perhaps they all cheer and feed him the urge to “keep the daily running streak alive.”

What’s worse I’m concerned that average people who watches his channel would think that running everyday for years even through injury is ok and then try it, thinking that “impossible is nothing,” or any of that crap. 

Ah anyway, I hope he heals and will come to realize that nobody is going to crucify him if he takes one or two days rest per week.

My gf then urged that both of us get tested for covid. We did and I tested positive. Luckily, it wasn't severe(might be due to the fact that Im a pretty healthy, young guy).

I never considered covid to be the cause since I never noticed the shortness of breath when I'm being stagnant/doing small things which, apparently, you should when you do have it. I only ever noticed it when I would be on my run.

Moral of the story: if you feel something while running/exercising and even if you don't feel anything while not active, whether it be minor aches and pains or subtle changes like immediate shortness of breath, if it lingers, stop what you're doing and get it checked out or (cautiously)self-diagnose and rest.

I’ve had soreness before so I thought it was that and realised I was running WAY faster than I thought and I knew I had to slow down. Stupidly, I tried to run the way back as it was raining a lot and I didn’t want to walk for half an hour to get back to my car. So like an idiot I ran another mile at a 10 min pace until I just couldn’t and walked back from there. 

I’m an idiot I know. But yesterday night and all day today I’ve had a limp on that leg as well as usual soreness in my right leg. It’s not my muscle that hurts and it’s not painful to touch. I can’t put my weight on it really until I’ve taken a few steps and it hurts to bend my knee as well as to stand on when I first stand up. 

I REALLY want to pass this assessment which I have on the 8th of September! Please tell me that with good rest and virtually no more running that I’ll be good to go by then.

I've always had problems with flat feet/very low arches, it's caused lots of pain in my legs and feet. My coach and trainer always mentioned that I should try insoles, but I've never bought any until now. So just today I went to a running store, had the store employee watch my walk to see what kind of insoles I should get, and I ended up getting what were called PowerStep insoles. According to the box they're lower profile insoles and they have medium level support and cushion. We did try another insole, but I didn't like the way they felt so I went with these ones. 

They actually felt good when I went walking and jogging around in them, but I went out to do 5 miles today and after the very first mile, my feet--specifically my arches--were aching and burning, and I ended up stopping. As a counterpoint, I haven't exactly been running due to an injury, so I might just have to get back into it, but should it hurt this much? My dad says I just have to break them in like actual shoes so I just have to run a little more in them.

Flash forward to now 27 became a dad mid July and have taken up calisthenics mixed with weightlifting (all calisthenics now due to covid) and dropped down to 178-182lbs up and down.

Hello [r/running](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/)

Me and some friends are doing a running challenge. We are to run a 3.5 mile run, or in other words, a 5k. I've done it several times before but this was last year summer time. Since then, I have gained 40 pounds. Some fat, some muscle. I want to try to aim for a 20-25 minute run by the end of it.

What would you guys recommend me to do in order to run a 5k in 20-25 minutes?

I am far from fast but I feel like there's progress. 5km PB I ran last week was 25:59, so I feel like the initial goal of a sub 25minute 5km is now possible over the coming months. (I was running at around 32/33mins earlier this year when I got up to my first 5k)

When I ran my 5k PB my av HR was 174.. and the last km was hard on the lungs!

For ref, I'm doing 3 runs pw. One between 8-10k, one 1hr cardio HIIT with 20minutes on the treadmill &amp; 1 around 5k with a decent-ish pace. I want one of these to be a tempo run and/or I may throw it in as an extra run as Im trying to do every other day.

I'm in my thirties and a lifelong powerlifter and bodybuilder. Always had lots! of strength and looked ridiculous fit but had very low lung capacity.. Never did distance running. Only short anaerobic stuff for sports. Wayyy back in high school I nearly ran a mile but had to walk part of it. 

Decided I want to wear a uniform with honor and have a very fun and badass job. 

6 weeks ago I couldn't run one lap without nearly suffocating. I started a run-walk progressive interval program. Last week I could only run 2 laps at a quick pace. I watched some youtube videos and got a little advice on this sub for how to better my technique and routine. 

This morning I decided to quit the babysteps intervals and just do a distance day at a slow pace. 

To be fair, I was VERY slow as I obviously wanted to have a good pace. I focused on perfect form and breathing. By lap 4 I barely broke a sweat and by the end I felt I could've gone another mile or two. I was shocked at how comfortable and consistent it was. My 2nd mile was within 5 seconds of the first mile.

Now, I need to get much faster. I can actually sprint extremely fast for my size. The challenge will be the balancing of speed over distance for getting that quicker pace.

I need a great time for 1.5 miles. And soon.

### Training
Race day was run streak day was 2,801. Not nearly enough hill or trail training.  Quarantine has been great for my training; I've been averaging nearly 11 miles a day in 2020. I did a few long runs of 30+.  I was going to run Western States this year, but it was cancelled, so instead I ran a 'solo' 60 mile run back in June from Philadelphia to my hometown in Macungie.  Typical training weeks were 70 miles, with a peak of 90.

### Race strategy
This has been a crazy time for everyone, I'm sure.  I honestly thought this race was going to get canccelled along with all the others.  However, the race directors put together a very comprehensive safety plan, and the race was ON!
Masks at aid stations, no spectators, only 1 crew member per person, starting in waves, among other things.  Figured this would slow me down a bit.

The elevation was ~8,000 feet, so I thought it would be similar to my previous run at [Umstead 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/bd8j2o/race_report_umstead_100_mile_endurance_run_just/).  I did Umstead in 20:32, so I was hoping I could trim some time off that and get under 20.  I WAS WRONG!

My good friend **A** also signed up for this race.  We had done the [Jackpot Endurance Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/7zk3m3/race_report_viva_las_vegas_a_24_hour_journey/) previously together. 

I planned 2 changes of clothes.  1 at mile 50, 1 at mile 80, with some backup rain gear and cold gear just in case. 

See here for [Packing List](https://imgur.com/gmjWXgK) 

My fiancee **J** would be my primary crew, with good friend **P** joining to help **A**.

Gu every 5 miles, salt tab every 10 miles, stop at every aid station to at least eat something.  Sip of water at least every mile. I packed my drop bags to refill on Gu / Salt / Chews, and gave candy and other food to my crew.

The course was out and back, so I planned no music for the first 50.  Pick up my headphones at the turnaround, and enjoy some tunes on the way back.


### Pre-race
Drove the ~6 hours from Philadelphia to Akron on Friday afternoon.  Checked into the hotel (right next to the start line!), grabbed our bibs, and got a decent pasta / pizza dinner at an italian place nearby.  Did some last minute planning, and went to bed by 8AM.  



### Race Day
Woke up around 3:00AM, quickly got ready, and walked over to the start line for our 4:21AM start.  The first group of 12 kicked off at 4AM with waves starting every 3 minutes. No spectators at the start (and the race director was shoo-ing people away!) so it was very different than all other races I've started, by a lot.

### Miles [1] to [25]

And we're off! The first mile was on a paved road with street lights, but after that, headed onto the trails around Cuyahoga National Park.  Headlamps were absolutely required.  It was cool to look back and see a trail of headlamps following in the woods.  The race directors recommended using the RaceJoy app so crew could track runners in the woods.  The app was good, but it could use some refinement, and I should have checked my settings more before starting.  It was audibly calling out split times every mile, which I'd prefer not to have, and it was a larger drain on my phone battery than expected.  It was VERY helpful in staying on the course.  The markers were generally OK, but there were at least 5 times when I wasn't sure which way to go, and a few times when the app had to remind me that I was off course. My watch also quickly started giving different readings than the app, I assume because of poor GPS coverage in the woods.   

I fell hard twice within the first 10 miles, and another time around mile 15.  This was a huge morale dampener.  The trail / tree roots / rocks were way trickier than I expected. My arms were hands and arms were bloody and we were barely started! 

Chatted with another runner who was only doing the first 50.  He was in much better spirits than I was!   Stuck with **A** through the first 20.  At the first major crew point, it was great to see the crew.  Restrictions allowed only runners near the aid station.  Typically I'd have crew help grab food from the aid station / refill water and ice, but that was restricted this year due to COVID.  Just a minor plan change that adds up.  **A** stopped to change, so I had a small lead, then he passed me around 25 and I wouldn't see him again for a bit.


### Miles [26] to [50]
Started to see fewer runners.  The aid stations were OK.  Masks were enforced for runners at the table; then you could walk off and eat in the rest area.  The food variety was a bit lacking.  Due to covid restrictions, there was no cooking in the parks, so I usually just picked up a few potato chips / pretzels, refilled my water and moved on.  Tried to get some ice in my hat when I could!  Saw the crew at mile 33.  My phone was already at 40% so I picked up my large charger and carried it in my pack.  Another change to the plan, but I was rolling with it.

At this point I was definitely walking up every hill, and most of the downhills too, since I didn't want to risk another spill. Miles ~44 - 50 were on a very flat path, with limited shade.  I wanted to run fast, but in the mid day heat, it just wasn't happening.  I ran whenever I passed through the shade of a tree!  Got to mile 50, around 10:30 in. Finally!  20 hours no longer felt like it was within reach.  

Saw **A** here for a little bit as he had just changed, then he took off.  I stopped to cram down a cheesesteak.  Even though I told my crew I didn't want anything - I REALLY appreciated this, since all the aid station food was cold so far.  It was a great boost.  Changed clothes, refueled, drank some soda, picked up my headphones, watch charger, and I was off.




### Miles [51] to [75]
Miles 50-56 were just as terrible on the way back.  Once I got into the woods again I picked up a little steam, but not much. Listened to 4 episodes of the Car Talk podcast then switched to music.  Passing a lot of runners going the other way and we would share very small words of encouragement.  ""You're looking great!""  Sure I am buddy, sure...

Getting to the aid station at 61 felt like it took forever!  The miles were crawling by.  Saw my crew at ~66.  Realized I needed to pickup my headlamp there since I wouldnt' see them until after dark at mile ~80.  Some more enjoyable sections of the tow path, and then the sun went down.  The dropping temperature was great!


### Miles [76] to [100] 

Saw **A** and the crew again at 80.  Changed, then **A** and I took off together.  I thought we'd be able to stick together, but I was really losing steam mentally at this point.  My legs felt fine, but every time I started jogging, I would hit a hill, or some tricky roots to navigate, and I gave up and started walking.

A lot of numbers were getting crunched in my head, and I started to question the feasibility of 24 hours.  If I crawl / roll at 30 minutes per mile, it'll only take 10 more hours!  Around mile 85 **A** was way ahead of me.  There were relay runners on the course, and they would FLY by me with words of encouragement.  That didn't help much!  

There's some terrible smelling recycling plant around mile 87 that I remembered passing earlier in the morning.  Getting close! Took another wrong turn around here.    

It also didn't help that my phone was bouncing around in my pocket, so it became disabled for 30 minutes, then 45 minutes at one point.  I was EXTREMELY frustrated as I could hear texts / notifications coming in but couldn't do anything.  Eventually resolved that, after some loud curse words in the woods.

Saw the crew again at mile ~91 and that was probably the lowest mentally I've ever been in a race.  My splits leading up to that were between 18-21 minutes / mile (mostly walking).  **J** and **P** gave me some motivation and refueled.  I knew they had a tough decision of seeing **A** at the finish, or me at mile 96, so that gave me some reason to pick up the dang pace.  

Continued trekking through the woods, but moved a bit faster starting at mile 94, as the end was so close!  My headphones were dead at this point but I started to listen to music out loud.  Called / family friends.  Saw **J** at the last crew stop at mile 96, then thankfully she was able to drive back to the finish line in time to see **A** cross!

Didn't see many other runners the last 3 miles. I knew if I could keep running at least a little bit, I could break 24 hours. Started to rain lightly, which was actually extremely refreshing.  Saw some spooky cat eyes in the woods!

Finally got back onto the home stretch of streets at mile 99.  My last mile split was 12:45 which felt like sprinting at that point!  Took the positive vibes and crossed the finish line!


### Post-race
20 gus, 10 salt tabs, 3 pairs of shoes / changes of clothes, a cheesesteak, and 100.4 miles later, I crossed the finish line just after 3:30AM, official time of 23:13:10, earning a sub-24 hour belt buckle.  **J** and **P** were there to cheer me on.  We collected the buckle then drove the ~4 blocks back to the hotel, which I really appreciated.  Everyone had been awake for ~24 hours at that point, so we were all just exhausted and ready for bed.

My legs were throbbing so I didn't really get any quality sleep until the next night.


### Reflections
I was really frustrated by the difficulty of the trail.  I has arrogant to think that it would be as easy as Umstead, or the other flat races that I'd done in the past.  This frustration just got me down during the race, and I didn't really get past it until the last 5 miles.  

I will need to train a lot harder for Western States next year!

Extremely appreciative of the crew we had with us.  With all the aid station limitations around COVID, I would not have been able to do it without such an all-star crew.  This was **P**'s first time, and he did great!

I do have to say that I was a little frustrated with the COVID restrictions, and the enforcement of them.  ""No Spectators"", but there were pretty big crowds at the aid stations and turnaround points.  Runners with crew teams of 5+ people, when we were only supposed to have 1.  If I had known that the rules weren't going to be enforced, I would have planned differently, or not run at all.  Safety first!

I wrote this up about 6 days later, so I may be misremembering some items.

### What's next?
Nothing really planned until Western States next June!  I'll need to hit some trails before then.

From: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/best-food-to-counter-the-effects-of-air-pollution/

Transcript:

Outdoor air pollution may be the ninth leading cause of death and disability in the world, responsible for millions of deaths from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory infection. In the U.S., living in a polluted city was associated with a 16, 27, and 28% increase in total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer death, compared to living in a city with cleaner air. Living in a city with polluted air may lead [to] up to a 75% increase in the risk of a heart attack. No one wants to be living in a traffic jam, but it’s better than dying in a traffic jam.

“In addition to causing deaths, air pollution is also the cause of a number of…health problems.” It may not only exacerbate asthma, but increase the risk of developing asthma in the first place. These pollutants may trigger liver disease, even increase the “risk of diabetes.” “[E]ven when atmospheric pollutants are within legally established limits, they can be harmful to health.” So, what can we do about it?

Paper after paper describing all the terrible things air pollution can do to us, but most failed to mention public policy. We’re making “great strides in demonstrating the harmful effects, [but] public authorities are not using these data to” reduce emissions, as they might inconvenience the population, “and, therefore, might not be politically acceptable.”

To treat the cause, we need better “vehicle inspections, efficient public transport,…bus lanes, bicycle lane[s], [even] urban tolls”—to help clean up the air. While we’re waiting for all that, is there anything we can do to protect ourselves?

Well, our body naturally has detoxifying enzymes, not only in our liver, but lining our airways. Studies showing that people born with less effective detox enzymes have an exaggerated allergic response to diesel exhaust, suggesting that these enzymes actively combat the inflammation caused by pollutants in the air. A significant part of the population has these substandard forms of the enzyme, but either way, what can we do to boost the activity of whichever detoxification enzymes we do have?

Well, if you remember, broccoli can dramatically boost the activity of the detox enzymes in our liver. But, what about our lungs? Researchers fed some smokers a large stalk of broccoli every day for ten days to see if it would affect the level of inflammation within their bodies. Why smokers? Because smoking is so inflammatory that you can end up with elevated C-reactive protein levels for “up to 30 years…after quitting,” and that inflammation can start almost immediately after we start smoking. So, it’s critical to never start in the first place.

But, if you do, you can cut your level of that inflammation biomarker CRP nearly in half, after just ten days eating a lot of broccoli. Appears to cut inflammation in nonsmokers as well—maybe explaining, in part, why eating more than two cups of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, or other cruciferous veggies a day is associated with 20% reduced risk of dying, compared to eating a third [of] a cup a day, or less.

So, what about air pollution? We know the cruciferous compound is “the most potent known inducer” of our detox enzymes; and so, most of the research has been on its ability to fight cancer. But, here, for the first time, they tried to see if it could combat “the proinflammatory impact of…pollutants such as diesel exhaust.” They took some human lung lining cells in a petri dish, and this is how many detox enzymes are produced. Drip on some broccoli goodness, and you can get this many. Yeah, but we don’t inhale broccoli; we don’t snort it; we eat it. Can it still get into our lungs and help? Yes, two days of broccoli-sprout consumption, then you suck some cells out of their nose, and up to 100 times more detox enzyme expression, compared to eating a non-cruciferous vegetable (alfalfa sprouts). Now, all we have to do is squirt some diesel exhaust up their nose, which is what some UCLA researchers did—an amount equal to daily rush-hour exposure on the Los Angeles freeway. Within six hours, the number of inflammatory cells in their nose shot up, and continued to rise. But, in the group that had been getting a “broccoli sprout extract,” the inflammation went down, and stayed down. 

Since the dose in these studies is equivalent to the consumption of one or two cups of broccoli, their “study demonstrates the potential preventive and therapeutic potential of broccoli.”

But, if broccoli is so powerful at suppressing this inflammatory immune response, might it interfere with normal immune function? After all, the battle with viruses, like influenza, can happen in the nose. Let’s drip some flu viruses into the nostrils of broccoli-sprout eaters, and find out. And, what you get is the best of both worlds—less inflammation, yet an improved immune response. Eat alfalfa sprouts, and you can get this kind of viral spike in your nose. But, after eating a package of broccoli sprouts every day, our body is able to keep the virus in check, potentially offering “a safe, low-cost strategy for reducing influenza risk” among high risk populations. So, better immune function, yet less inflammation, potentially “reducing the impact of…pollution on allergic disease and asthma”—at least for “an enthusiastic broccoli consumer.”

But, what about cancer, detoxifying air pollutants throughout the rest of our body? We didn’t know, until now. Off to China, where they have some of the worst air pollution in the world. And, by day one, those getting the broccoli sprouts were able to get rid of 60% more benzene from their bodies, a “rapid…highly durable elevation [in] the detoxification of…a known human carcinogen.” Now, this was using broccoli sprouts, which are highly concentrated—equivalent to about five cups of broccoli a day. So, we don’t know how well more modest doses would work. But, if they do, eating broccoli could provide “a frugal means to attenuate [the] long-term health risks” of air pollution.",running,Octagon_Time_Machine,False,/r/running/comments/ii9hvf/for_those_of_you_who_cant_give_up_running_outside/

I've been running 3-4 times a week, always at least a day of rest in between every run for the last few months and I'm currently roughly half way through the Garmin Coach Half Marathon program. It's been going well and part from some slight knee pain earlier this summer, which made me rest for a week, I haven't had any issues and made sure I've gradually increased distance/pace.

It could possibly be because I ran my farthest distance so far this Monday morning, a 15k, however I felt quite strong during the run and part from being a bit tired in my legs I didn't have problems afterwards. I should say that I typically run 6-8k and the occasional 10k, according to the Garmin Coach program. Tuesday and Wednesday went by and no pain or soreness at all, I played Badminton as I do every week and everything felt the same. Which is why I'm a bit surprised that I had some leg pain yesterday, and still feeling it a bit when walking today (Friday). Other reasons could possibly be that it's starting to get colder, and I rode my bike with shorts yesterday. And I rarely, if ever, stretch.

This is for someone who plans their own training, and doesn't use a coach through a platform like TP or Final Surge.

Some features included:

* Drag and drop training plan builder
* Workout templates for commonly used workouts
* Recommended training plans for goal distance races (5K, 10K, Half Marathon, Marathon, Ultra's etc.)
* Include cross-training workout's (Cycle, Swim + other)
* Load indicator (""Your workouts + volume for the week look like they are too big of a step up from the week before, consider taking it a bit easier"")
* Sync with Garmin, Suunto, Strava
* Email reminders for upcoming workouts. 
* Weather clashes (Eg: When planning your week, you get told that a workout is booked during a forecast cold-front)
* Calendar clashes (Syncs with GCal or Outlook and fits in workout's according to your work/life schedule)
* Community training hub for specific race training. (Matches you with similar strength runners in your area for group training runs)
* Potential discounts with a shoe and apparel partner
* Group buy race entries at a discount

3 months ago I picked up an injury on my right hip/groin side. I don't know exactly what it was because I didn't visit a doctor (Covid era), but what started as a tightness on the outside of my hip, became a discomfort on the front of the hip and later a sharp pain in the groin. My best guess is hip-flexor.

I stopped running completely, gave it a shot 3 weeks later and failed. Waited a few more weeks and was able to run a little (3x of 2 miles) during a week and then the pain was back. I stopped again.

Now its been 3 months and I feel it is time to try again. Before the injury I felt great and had just finished a training program where I peaked at \~9 miles on my long runs.

My question is: After 3 months without running, how easy should I start in terms of milage? I believe I should probably do a couple weeks only running short distances like 1 or 2 miles at a time, but after that how do I increase? Any advices?

I’m 5 weeks away from my first marathon and training is going relatively well. Hitting my bench marks, yasso 800s a few weeks ago went well. On target for my goal pace, 8:20-8:30 splits.

One day at practice, I was doing strides getting ready for an interval workout. I think on my second stride I felt excruciating pain in my left achilles, and started to limp badly. I've never been injured before, so I went to tell me coach. I ended up not finishing the workout. This was nearly a year ago, last fall. I ended up not being able to run at all for about 4 months, but I did a good amount of cross training (aqua jogging, biking) it was really difficult though because for all the time I missed running my coach made me do 1.5x the amount I missed. So a 90 minute long run would turn into 2 hours of straight biking. This was really hard to accommodate since I was taking some really tough classes.

Throughout these 4 months I ended up eating more than usual, and if I'm being honest I ate a bit more junk food than usual. To the normal person, I seem skinny, but my stomach protrudes a tiny bit. This is VERY noticable to me though, because I used to be so skinny you'd be able to see my ribs.

(AKA: Why do my glutes and hips get tight, but not my calves, quads, and hamstrings?)",1598562411,"I'm in the middle of my first marathon training block and I've been thinking a lot about perception of strain and muscle fatigue and tightness, knowing when to push through and when to rest, and knowing what different muscle tightness/soreness/fatigue tells us about form, routine, and muscle imbalances. Training blocks are good for teaching you how to keep running on tired legs, to practice manageable overload, but if I wonder what perceived strain during a training block tells each of us about technique and training practices.

I'll give my own case as an example: when I first started taking training more seriously, I would never feel my glutes truly engage when I was running and couldn't *make* them turn on either — it wasn't really until I started doing hill repeats that I felt them working on a run more regularly. And yet I also noticed that even before this, it is always my glutes (and a bit my hips) that get tight after a run and never my hamstrings, calves, and quads. This surprises me in particular because I'd say the vast majority of people on here when talking about tightness after a run talk about their calves first. I've wondered what this means in terms of my form, and I've guessed that it means that while my form is ok, my glutes are underdeveloped in comparison to the rest of my posterior chain (from years of disuse), so any engagement they get is going to tax them more and I'll feel the strain more. This would also explain why the rest of my chain is generally ok, because it's strong from picking up the slack from my weak ass. 

Naturally, I know this muscle imbalance will improve over time if I stick to the hill workouts, squats, etc. But I also think it's still a little odd that calf tightness seems to the most common form of muscle fatigue from running and I never experience it. Is it normally the case that people's calves are \*less\* developed than their glutes, or are people's glutes generally underdeveloped and that's why their calves are taking on all of the work? Or, is this all really a form issue and does relative muscle soreness have more to do with the way you run?

**TL;DR: What do you think we can reliably or productively read into relative muscle fatigue? And why do people always complain about sore calves more than any other part of the chain? And what does it mean if your calves don't get sore but your glutes do?**",running,djmuaddib,False,/r/running/comments/ihtlgl/how_to_read_muscles_during_a_training_block_aka/

It has helped me control my disordered eating and helped me become a healthier person altogether. I started off slow, running .5 to 1 mile at 14 min a mile stopping frequently around 4-5 times a week. I figured the calories burned weren't enough to log so I omitted entering my weight for the ""calories burned"" purpose. Now, a couple of months later I'm running 2-2.5 miles with little to no stops at an 11 to 12-minute mile. 

I am currently on a caloric deficit and have been wondering if logging those calories as well would be necessary now that I'm burning a significantly larger amount of energy than I was then. I currently eat around 1800 ish a day,  give or take 150 ish cals. 

It's also worth noting I am 17 Y 5'6F and struggle with restrictive eating and binge eating, although ever since I picked up running I have been doing very well at managing this, I track my calories to make sure I don't overeat too much but I mostly do intuitive eating, not restricting any foods to avoid getting into that disordered mindset again. At 14 I was super restrictive eating &gt;900-1000 calories a day losing lots of weight, messing up my menstrual cycle, and had hair loss. I would track every single calorie I ate, even if it was HALF a grape. This was awful, and going back onto this type of eating is terrifying, hence why I initially didn't want to know how much energy I was burning to avoid all the strict logging which is how I got into that situation in the first place.

I am quite happy with my Forerunner 245, and since I do not want to run the same route, I also recently made heavy use of the navigation feature. However, the 245 only shows the route that I have created without any more information about my surroundings. Often I see myself running at turning in the wrong direction (e.g. due to several roads in a forest next to each other), and then have to turn back. Also, when doing some workout, I am constantly switchung my screens from navigation to interval to pace and back. Very distracting.

So, I was looking at other options. The obvious (and expensive ones) are, for example, replacing the 245 with the 945 or the Fenix 6 Pro.  Interestingly, the latter does not really cost more than the 945 where I am living. With a new watch, I would be able to see the actual map while running, but I would still need to go through several screens during my running.

New to the sub, I’ve been lurking a little. I’ve finally decided to post because I’m Frustrated/unsure of how to proceed with what “looks” like my next step in improving. I have been reading up on zone 2 Aerobic training and how it is crucial to improve speed/performance in endurance running.

Some background for me. I started running seriously at the beginning of the pandemic lockdowns in March didn’t really have much else to do so I gave it a go. I set an original goal of just getting into shape (dropped 25 lbs from 195 to 170 from March to June) From there I figured I wanted to try for a half since I had never ran one before. Accomplished that in mid June.

Reason I’m posting today. Simply Zone 2 training. I have drank the Koolaid reading about its importance, and I have identified that this entire time I have never trained in this zone. Ever. All of my runs have been 155+ BPM. My Half Marathon was an avg of 157 BPM and my other PRs all are in the range of 170 BPM.


I have calculated the top of my peak zone 2 to be around 133 BPM using some apps online. Trying to run in this zone has been a struggle to say the least. I have given 4 workouts this week and they are all averaging 13:00 per mile or so. I generally have been giving myself an hour to run and just getting as many miles as I can in that hour. Its frustrating as hell going this slow. 


Why am I here with this wall of text? Is this pacing normal starting out? Am I at the right heart rate for zone 2, as there are some different numbers based on where I calculate this. How many miles should I try to run in this zone daily? Weekly? Should I be focusing on time instead of Mileage? Previously I would have a goal distance to run, never a time. I will stick at this if I’m doing the right thing but I want to make sure that I am starting out on the right foot. Thanks for all of your help!

I run; 

Monday/Friday 3miles each

Tuesday/Thursday 2 miles each (with a 30 minute stop for free exercises)

Wednesday/Saturday/Sunday I rest and/or bike

I stretch before each run, I take a cold shower after each run. I started icing my shins about two weeks ago, and I do that for about 30 minutes. I take a hot bath every other day (on top of the cold shower). 

I bought special expensive insoles molded to my feet. I bought two pairs of compression sleeves for my calves (im right on the cusp of large and extra large sizes, so i got extra large to wear while I run and a large to wear while I rest)

It seems like very little is helping and after 15 minutes of running, every step is painful.

Not sure if it matters but the trail I run on is very hilly.

I work in the armed forces so have to follow group training sessions regardless.

Over  lockdown I stepped up my training and have spent 4 or 5 months managing 40-45 miles per week.

Work has been back to normal for a few weeks and so it's hard to maintain a routine when I have to do compulsory training aswell. (This could be running/circuits and many other things) 

So I've come up with an idea to keep my miles up and wondered if you guys think this will work to  help build on fitness

So basically ontop of the work training I do 5-6 of my.own runs a week.

I'll always do a sprint session  the day after a rest to ensure I'm fresh and its 8x800m or 6x1k with a couple miles warm up cooldown

At some point I do an easy 10 mile run (about 7:30-7:45)

I try to fit a longer run 13-15 miles (same pace as 10 miler. If work has been hard training wise I will sometimes reduce this to another 10 miler

Then I will do 2 or 3 very easy sessions which are usually 6-8 miles at 8-8:30 a mile

4375,4375,4375,7,Tired/heavy legs issue,1598542631,"30F, 115 lbs, non-smoker, low thyroid condition already treated with meds

Hi fellow runners,

It seems that the majority of my runs are done on tired/heavy legs. I've been running since March 2020 and I gradually upped my weekly mileage somewhere between 30-40km. I usually run 10k 3 to 4 times a week to be exact. My runs are considered what you would call fairly ''easy'' and I usually keep a 6:00min/km pace. I'm not into speed work yet, as I'm enjoying long easy runs for now and I like it that way. When I feel that my legs are starting to really get this heavy feeling I'm talking about, I usually rest for two days (time for the muscles to repair), although this doesn't seem to help as much as I'd like it to.

At first I thought this was due to upping my weekly mileage too quickly, which would have made sense, however I've been doing around 30k/week for at least 2-3 months now, and the issue is still there.

Other causes I think might be related to the tired-legs issue:

\- I've lost quite a lot of weight since I've started running (around 15lbs). Maybe I'm not eating enough for my muscles to fully repair after each run? I'd say I eat around 1800cal a day. I have a pretty clean and balanced diet. I also eat the occasional red meat (iron) and lots of good fats (nuts, avocado, pb, etc.)

\- I'm not very disciplined with stretching. I do stretch quickly after my run sometimes, but not all the time. Would this really make a difference?

\- I saw a post somewhere on this subreddit mentioning that ''cadence'' could play a role. Would making my cadence faster help with the issue?

Or might it be that it's actually normal to run through tired legs...?

4383,4383,4383,15,Prone to Injury and need help!,1598536352,"Hello Everyone!

First time posting here, so let me know if I do anything wrong.

For some context which may or may not be necessary: I was a passionate runner all through highschool. I was a good runner, recording 5km in the 18 min range and 10km times under 40min. At my peak I was 5' 11"" and 165lbs. 

Then University and work stopped majority of my physical activity if not all. I gained a bunch of weight hovered around 205lbs. 3.5 years later, In my last 4 months of school I decided to get myself back in shape. I started to run again. My first run was 3km and it was horrible. Very slow and I felt bad. However, after a month of trying to run, I started to notice a difference. By the end of the school semester I was running 40km a week and I felt great. I dropped to 175lbs. 

Then, exams hit, followed by a vacation and moving back home to a place with no treadmill in the middle of winter. I tried my best to have an occasional run in the snow but there were very few. My weight jumped to 185lbs, which I was able to maintain with my occasional winter run. 

As soon as the cold months were over I was ready to run as much as I could! I had some goals in mind that I wanted to complete over the summer. I wanted to do a 5 km in under 20 min and run a half marathon. While between fast paced 5km and 10-15km distance runs. ""Surprisingly"" I became injured. 

I am still unsure what the injury is. The pain is around the muscles in my shin. I originally thought shin splints, but I have had those before and this felt different. So I went to the doctors and described the pain. It is in my right leg starting 2 inches above my ankle. It's on the front outside of my leg. The best way to describe it is: it feels like I am wearing socks that are to tight, which in turn makes my leg feel weak. Almost like I couldn't support my body weight on that leg.  Well the doctor told me it sounds like a muscle injury over shin splints but either way take 7 days of rest and see what happens. So I stopped running for 7 days and still no signs of improvement. So I didn't run for 2 months and gained some weight. 

I am currently 192lbs and went for my first run after 2 months. It was just 2.5km and it felt good. So I waited a couple of days and did another 2.5km and then a 5 km. After 2 weeks of small and spread out runs. I started run normally, which is a 5km-8km run. I did about 5 of them in the past week. Which up until yesterday felt good. Now the pain is back just like before. 

I am at a loss of what to do as I obviously have a problem gaining weight and running helps a lot. I also love it. To me there is no better feeling than working towards a running goal.

Additional information: I do some dynamic stretching and warm ups before I run. As well as all the recommended post run stretches. Followed by 15 min of shin splints stretches.

I mentioned my weight a lot in the above because I think it might play a big factor. When I tell people my running times they don't believe me because I don't look like I can run very well. So I'm worried that I may be pushing myself to hard even though I often feel fine on my runs. 

I am just looking for any and all suggestions.

I've been running 3-4 times a week, always at least a day of rest in between every run for the last few months and I'm currently roughly half way through the Garmin Coach Half Marathon program. It's been going well and part from some slight knee pain earlier this summer, which made me rest for a week, I haven't had any issues and made sure I've gradually increased distance/pace.

It could possibly be because I ran my farthest distance so far this Monday morning, a 15k, however I felt quite strong during the run and part from being a bit tired in my legs I didn't have problems afterwards. I should say that I typically run 6-8k and the occasional 10k, according to the Garmin Cach program. Anyhow Tuesday and Wednesday went by and no pain or soreness at all, I played Badminton last night as I do every week and everything felt the same. Which is why I'm a bit surprised that I had some leg pain today (Thursday).

Other reasons could possibly be that it's starting to get colder, and I rode my bike with shorts yesterday. I rarely, if ever, stretch. Yesterday I worked at a café on a somewhat uncomfortable chair.

Has anyone had a similar experience or have any ideas what could have caused this? Should I just rest till it has passed? Also, what are your routines to prevent injury and other problems?

4393,4393,4393,26,As a new runner I need some advice! Thank you.,1598530446,"Hey everyone. So I have recently taken up running again and felt soooo good for doing it for around a month now.

I purchased a Huawei GT2 which was supposedly very good at tracking your aciticty, your recovery time, that tracks anaerobic and aerobic training as well as vo2max etc.

So I am a 177cm guy that weighs in at 92kg. I am a bit overweight but I've been losing 4 kg in a month and feel really happy about it since I started running. It feels great.

Basically my questions:

* So my watch calculates vo2max and when I started running I was at 43 ml/kg/min which is considered ""fair"" and I've dropped times significantly (went from doing 6 minute 54 seconds per km ((3km)) runs to 6 minute 14 second per km (4km)) runs). The first times felt exhausting but the most recent runs I've felt much much better. However, the vo2max keeps dropping and I am currently at 40. What is this indicating? Am I pushing too hard? Is the climate too humid? Is it because I've also lost weight?

* So the clock also calculates the pulse and therefore if I am doing aerobic or anaerobic training. Last night I was going for anaerobic training to try and see how I faired and I was running with a pulse of 160 avg for 4km (which is around 70-80% of my max pulse). The watch said I did not do any anaerobic training gain that run, isn't that weird? It said during the whole run that I was in that phase. 

* I know a lot of people here say that you shouldn't care too much about stats and just run in their pace and enjoy it. I get that. But what should I mainly be thinking of if I want to maximize the training and still have fun doing so? I am still super eager to get out there and run and I feel extremely motivated because of the stats I am showing without feeling extremely exhausted after a run.

* The watch also calculates how long of a resting period I should have based off of my stats during the previous run. So if the watch have seen that I had a pulse of 90% max heart rate it will deter me from running for up to 40 hours which is fair. Usually now days since I've been running for little over a month it usually just tells me 24 hours since I am not dead after every run (I was super exhausted from 1 or 2 runs in the beginning)

Training

No real training plan. I run between 0 and 4 times a week. Usually I run a 5k, 5 miles, or a 10k just depending on how I feel once I get started.

Pre-race
Had been keeping an eye on the weather and saw a drastic improvement in Dew Point coming and decided to push myself. In the last week and a half I ran 10k, 13k, 9k, and 5k each faster splits than the previous with a day or 2 off in between.

Race

It was a perfect afternoon! 73°, 30% Humidity, 8 mph breeze. I was hoping to be consistent and run close to 5 minute splits the whole way, but came out of the gates faster than planned. 0.5 km in I knew I could break my 1k record so I went for it.

Decided to slowly ease my way back toward the 5 min pace and slowed down by 5 to 6 seconds on kms 2 through 4 running 4:37, 4:43, and 4:48.

Felt ok but a little gassed and disappointed when I realized at km 4 that I wasn't going to beat my 5k PR and hit a small wall that stuck with on kms 5-7 running them in 5:05, 5:09, and 5:11.

Then I realized that I could make another goal that I'd been targeting for awhile of 5 miles in 40:00. Ran km 8 in 4:55 to make it easily at about 39:10. This also when I realized that I was definitely going to break 50:00 and held near my target pace at 5:01 and 4:58 to finish strong and hit 49 minutes exactly. 


Post-race

I finished my loop maybe a quarter mile from my house and slowly walked back and did some light stretching. Drank water until I felt rehydrated and then drank a beer to celebrate.

No idea, but probably start increasing my distance until I can run my first ever half marathon. Currently my longest run is 13km in 68:21.

Two weeks ago my gf broke up with me completely unexpectedly. I haven’t had the easiest two weeks after that so yesterday I decided to go for a run and challenge myself. But first some background information!

I was a chubby kid growing up and I hated running since my parents forced me to run a 5k too fast too soon, ofcourse it was for my own good. Eventually I had to do some excercise so some years later I took up sprintkayaking and got pretty fit. I paddled for 5 years and during that time I think I built an ok aerobic base. Well I had to stop kayaking and for the last 3 years I’ve focused on gym. 

My muscles grew pretty fast but I also started to gain some fat since I didn’t do any cardio at all. During my biggest bulk I weighted 100kg. I had almost forgotten how it felt to be in a good aerobic shape.

Then COVID-19 came. My options were homeworkouts which I’m not a huge fan of and running. So I went for a run. Only difference was that this time I told to myself ”Don’t go too fast or you’ll end up messing this up again like 8 years ago”. So I ran slow and steady, tried to keep my heartbeat low and breath flowing. I got hooked.

Now almost half a year later quite much has changed. I’ve ran my longest run ever 16km, I weight 88kg, I feel so much better and I’m still completely hooked on running. When I started to run in March I ran 10k and my pace was 6:30 and avg bpm 158. My latest easy 10k was with pace of 6:15 and avg bpm 142. Easy to see the improvement!  Running has become equally important to me as gym now!

Back to the beginning. So my gf broke up with me and it hit me pretty hard. After the griefing phase I knew I needed to challenge myself and accomplish something to get my head back in the game and start living life again. I went for a 10k with one goal in my mind. Personal best (last was 54:00). I didn’t care about bpm this time or about anything else than running all out 10k and see what I can do. I entertained myself with the thought of breaking 50:00. Had a hell of a run (Almost stopped at 8km but it wasn’t an option) and when the last kilometer started I saw I could break 50:00 if I with a pace of 4:15. So I went all out and finished 10k in 49:49! Damn it felt good!!

I’m a beginner-ish runner. I ran cross country in school (half a life ago), then intermittently picked it up through my 20s. At my best I ran a few 5ks (around 33-36 minutes, I’m not speedy) and the longest run of my life was 5 miles; both of these were 5 or 6 years ago. At that time I went to a running store and had them watch my gait to get the right shoes (neutral strike). Obviously I have had a few pairs since then but I assume my strike is the same.

I picked it back up this year and seem to have problem after problem. Earlier in COVID (March/April) I was running about 2.5 miles 3 times a week, working up my running time with a couch to 10k app. In April I took a few weeks off because I hurt my IT band (I think), which resolved with rest and stretching. 

In May my foot started to hurt. I’m pretty sure it’s plantar fasciitis; I have seen my doctor three times and have a podiatry appointment next month, but everything takes longer from COVID. I rested completely for about a month, have been icing, and have been trying to really stretch my feet/calves. It starts to feel fine, then I go for a slow little mile-long trot and despite ice and stretching have a limp the next day. 

I did discover I have flat feet, so I am trying some insoles that seem to be helping. Deeper calf stretches seem to help too. Do any of y’all have flat feet? Plantar fasciitis? What helps? I really don’t want to just give up on the idea of running altogether.

I made the challenge to myself to run at least a 5k everyday for 30 days, looking for time improvement and weight loss. 

The first day I could not even continuously run the entire 5k and looked to the web for advice, that’s when I stumbled upon this sub. Helpful tips such as “don’t go too fast” and performing maintenance runs were invaluable to me.

Fast forward and I’ve just completed my 31st day of consecutive 5k’s (I didn’t count the first none continuous run in my final tally). It has been a fantastic experience and I even found myself running greater distances later in the month, such as my first 10k. 

I was able to drastically improve my time from over 30 minutes to just around 23 minutes! I also have lost roughly 10 pounds when I was not really overweight to begin with. I have never felt better or fitter after this past month, and now I look forward to extending my 5k streak to as long as I can! Thanks to this sub and I guess quarantine for helping me discover a love I didn’t know I had! I’m willing to answer any questions about my training any other beginners may have.

Today I got my first continuous 5k under my belt, I’ve done the distance before with breaks or periods of waking, but today was the first time I ran start to finish. Total time of 32:45 for a distance of 5.4k so there’s plenty of room for improvement, but I’m totally stoked! 

I started the NHS C25K plan back at the start of lockdown, but abandoned it to do my own thing after week six - this was a mistake, I ended up trying to go too far too fast and progress was slow.

Half a year ago I therefore upgraded to a chest strap, but I still didn't get reliable results. All too often the measured HR shoots up and down, and the measurements just don't make sense. Also, I don't like the feeling of a strap around my chest, so I went back to the wrist measurements and experimented a bit. Now it seems I stumbled upon an easy fix that is worth sharing here. 

The trick that does it for me is to strap the GPS watch higher up on my underarm, and to wrap a dark wrist band around the watch. This achieves two things: 1) the HR sensor gets pressed firmly against my skin and stops shaking and moving, and 2) stray light into the optical sensor gets avoided. 

For me this works like a charm. The downside is that I have to lift up the wrist band during running in order to see any info on the watch face, but for me this is a small price to pay to get decent HR data. (And on the flip side, there is the side benefit that I now look less frequently at my watch and run more on feel.)

I know that there are world class runners that can't touch their toes. I accept both those positions.  I am saying that over time, running causes the body to gradually tighten up. Legs, back, shoulders, everything. And that all that tightness leads to discomfort and limits your ability to do and enjoy other things. 

Adopting a full body stretching routine can counteract the affects and, in fact, even result in a level of flexibility that you may not have enjoyed before. And I am also saying that your quality of life in your later years will be greatly enhanced, enabling you to stay active and easily/painlessly do things that other ""seniors"" wouldn't even think about doing. It may even allow you to run longer, years longer. I've even been told that flexible people tend to look younger than 

There are many stretching routines/programs out there, find one that suits you and make it part of your regular fitness program.  Try it for a few weeks or months, not just days, because progress will come slowly, just as your body slowly tightened up over the years.  If one program doesn't work for you, try another. Or combine parts of several programs into something that will provide full body stretching and that you can endure if not, at some point, enjoy. I can say this with some certainty as I am 72, still running and more flexible now than I was 30 years ago.

Don't let age and stiffness control your life. Run on and stretch often.

Hi all! I’m in the market for new shoes and taking a critical look at the model I’ve been wearing for ten models—the Mizuno Wave Rider (13-23). When I first bought them, I never really looked into “drop”. I liked them and they’ve worked for me for a long time (college xc, many halves, 2 marathons). 

Recently, I’ve been experiencing more and more running aches than ever before. Most recently, I’ve been having top of foot pain and I think it may be the size I’ve been getting is too small. I always bust a hole through the tops! I thought before I just repurchase the latest model, I might reanalyze. 

From what I can determine, the Wave Rider has a pretty high drop. I’m a toe striker, though. And I will get reanalyzed at a show store, but still thinking I need neutrals. Should I be looking into something with less drop? Does anyone have experience experimenting with different drops? Or rotate shoes with varying drop? (Also as someone who has been running for 20+ years, I feel like I looked into heel size but not heel to toe difference. Is this new-ish, or have I been living under a rock?)

4494,4494,4494,30,"[Question] Recently have been struggling to hit my normal pace, what am I doing wrong?",1598459765,"Hey all, 

I started running around 20 months ago, all my running is done outdoors rather than a treadmill. After a couple of months I was running 3x 5k's a week at an 11-12 minute mile pace (I know this is slower than most runners, but I'm doing my best). Some days would be faster, some slower, but I averaged this pace. 

This year I started feeling like I had a lot left in the tank after each run, so I started running 10k's at the same pace. Shortly after I bumped it up to 6x 10k's a week and maintained that for a few month or so, and then took a week off, then resumed. Recently, a personal trainer recommended I dial back my running a bit and add in some stair stepper. 

For about a month I was running 4 times a week, and stair stepping 3. I noticed I was struggling to maintain my pace, so I started running on the treadmill which forced me to keep a steady pace.  

Fast forward to now, and the past month or so I've been pushing for 5-6 days a week of outdoor running. The trouble is, I cannot seem to push my legs hard enough to meet my pace. If I'm lucky, I'm hitting a 13 minute mile pace and it feels like I'm speed walking. All in all, the feeling of high energy I got when I started running 10k's has dissipated, and I feel sapped. 

Other info: 
I lift 4x a week
Sleep 8-9 hours a night 
I run fasted, but hydrate and drink coffee before hand. I've tried running unfasted but I feel bogged down. 
I am currently eating at a calorie deficit, which has been true since I started running. 

Age: 30 
Sex: M
Current MPW + pace: 30 MPW / ~13-14 minute mile 
Previous peak MPW: 37MPW / ~11-12 minute mile 
Previous PRs: 10k @ 10 minute mile pace

**Obviously, I'm doing something wrong. I would love help finding out what that is.** I have given myself a couple of days off of cardio to try to rest up, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. Could it be the heat? Do I need to rest longer than two days? Is there something I should change in my diet to give myself more energy on runs?

4528,4528,4528,66,Running my first sub 20min 5k without specifically focusing on running.,1598438041,"When Corona started and the lockdowns began I started getting back into soccer big time. Was adhering to a decent diet and just now, after 3 months of training, I ran my first sub 5k, a 19:52. I do have to mention that before I started training for soccer I was bicycling quite a bit, last  year I bicycled roughly 4000 kilometers, this year I have only bicycled \~600km which was mainly before I started training for soccer. I did not bicycle before 2019. 

**Personal Info:**

20 Years old

Male

180cm / 5'11

\~74kg / 163lbs

**My plan:**

Day1: Soccer training (wont bother you with the details here) + Plyometrics

Day2: Soccer training + Upper body workout

Day3: Soccer training + Interval running (30s sprint 30s off) or a 5k. I would swap this around every cycle

Day4: Rest

I repeated this for roughly 3 months. I think its worthwile mentioning that before running the 19:52 I had a restday the day before because of some small pains in my right shoulder, luckily these where gone on the day of the run.  

**My diet** wasnt anything too dialed, I eat roughly 3k calories. These calories consited of about 180g of protein, 130g of fat (have had people tell me this is too much but have not seen myself gain much fat), and about 230g Carbohydrates (too little here, I know..). And ofcourse drink plenty of water. 

I did not drink any alcohol during these months, no sodas. Just water &amp; Smoothies. 

**Supplements**

Omega 3,6,9 pills

Multi Vitamins

Protein Whey

Creatine

Basically I just bought a pair of runners, and they only have half a thumb's space at the front. I couldn't decide whether I should exchange for half a size up to get that thumb's space. When I tried that half a size up, it felt a bit too spacious. When I tightened up the laces on the half a size up, the lacing spacing also looked tight, while the current size lacing looks about right. That's why I started looking into the justification for that thumb spacing to see whether I need it or not, and I still can't decide.

Hi all,

Some backstory, my brother and I were due to run an official race called the St Albans Stampede (UK) the first weekend in September. The event is cancelled because of COVID, but we're going to run around our town instead. We're raising money for charity (don't think I can post details so won't include here). 

We're trying to keep it as authentic as possible with similar elevation change and lap distance (6.5km) but we're really not sure if we should be aiming to cover more distance in one go on fresh legs, complete one lap each until the time runs out, things like that. We wen't out for a 26k yesterday (equivalent of 4 laps) and the pace just dropped off for the last 1/3. 

We're aiming for 20 laps in 12 hours, more if we can. That's what the official winners got last year. But if one of us locks up or gets an injury, we're toast, so if you have any advice on that front as well, that would be grand.

4569,4569,4569,9,Tendon achilles bothers me,1598399273,"Hi there!

First, sorry English is not my first language so idk how I'll explain this.

I've been running for some years already, and just only in one occasion I had a contusion on my knee that stopped me of running during a whole month. Lately I've changed my shoes, from a Vomero 12 to a Zoom Fly 3.

This last Monday I went to do my speed run, and for some circumstances I had to do some sudden turn back which almost makes me fall on the track, so I changed I try to run with doing less curve. But since yesterday I've been feeling that my tendon achilles bothers me, I don't have any pain but I don't have it in a normal situation where it doesn't bother me. It feels tight, and it's kind of annoying. Also I gotta say it's not only achilles but also it's my ankle which also bothers me.

So it's not pain, but I don't feel it normal and I don't know what it is. Someone has suffered the same? I don't know what to think, if it's tendinitis but hopefully it will go away in some days.

I have to say, during this week my next run it's supposed to be on Saturday, but obviously I won't do it if I still feeling the same, I have to play safe.

4573,4573,4573,13,My calves have been sore pretty much continuously since May,1598397313,"Like the title says, I’ve been struggling with calf soreness for months. I’ve been running about 30 miles a week since then, and I haven’t been able to increase my max distance past a half marathon since then, and I think it’s my calves holding me back. I have been running on hills one or two days a week, but other than that my runs are mostly flat.Pretty much every day when I lay down for a nap I have to put my calf sleeves on because my legs feel wonky. Three weeks ago I pushed through one of the hardest runs I’ve had to finish a half again and all day if I even stood on my tiptoes I’d get calf spasms for a few seconds.

I’ve tried foam rolling, calf stretches, warm baths, slowing down, and not much is helping. They were bad on Saturday (only ran nine miles when the rest of me wanted to run more) so I took two days off, did an easy 4 miles today, and they’re back to killing me. I’m gonna take two more days off and try to run Friday, but it’s not too promising (have done some light swimming though)

Is it my form or my shoes? I took a slow mo video to see if I was toe striking. It didn’t look too bad on a flat surface, but my feet were definitely rolling outward. It could be different on hills though (apparently slow mo videos on your iPhone can’t be uploaded to YouTube in slow mo, but the regular speed is [here](https://youtu.be/beYpCvKE9ko)

I (31,M) am a newly converted ""stander"" after working an office job with long hours for ~10 years (ouch). I am a keen runner, however due to building up from low mileage (tight hips/TFL/knee fun last year) I am only currently sitting on around +40km/w (25miles) looking to build pragmatically back to 60-80km (50miles) over next year.

I would like to learn from any experienced ""standers"" a few key main things:

1. How much it impacts recovery - keeping in mind inherently tight hips/TFLs
2. Should I sit immediately post run to aid recovery?
3. Given I am increasing load with running should I also approach the standard desk in a similar, pragmatic and incremental way.

I know the LT benefits to my bad posture and not sitting like a scrunched up pretzel, but I want to be sensible provided my love of running (and therefore recovery).

Any advice would be so so grateful!! I will caveat the above by saying that after a week of standing 0.75 of the working day with breaks, that I am noticing a bit of extra tightness in hips. Being aware that this could be a red herring and its actually the running rather than the standing!

4582,4582,4582,22,Uncomfortable to minor pain in only my right groin/psoas area.,1598392109,"Hey Runnit,

Quick question for you guys. Not looking for medical advice, as much as I am looking for insight to what might be causing this recent pain. 

I'm not much of a runner. I'm more of a calisthenics and light weights kind of exercise guy. Recently, I have been contemplating a job that requires running as a pt test. My girlfriend and I have started this routine to help increase my running endurance and get me into even better shape. It's 8 weeks of running and core exercise. Starting out, it was 4 days of exercise, with three of them being running and ab work, and the fourth being an all body exercise. The runs bounce between 1.5miles and 2.5miles, working up to 3 miles. Now, on week 4, there are 5 days of exercises and only 2 rest days.

A couple of weeks ago I started getting a slight uncomfortable feeling in my right groin area. I figured I just needed to stretch more. However, the pain continued to grow. Soon, I wasn't able to finish one of our interval training days, and had to walk the rest of the way. Walking in itself became painful. I did some research and it seemed like it could be the psoas muscle being overused in the core and running exercises. The info gave me some exercises to strengthen other muscles that would take some of the stress off of the right psoas. I've been trying to incorporate them in my routine in order to mitigate some of the pain. It has worked to an extent, but not what I was hoping. We did 2.25miles today and it started hurting at about the 1.5mile mark. Now, walking is uncomfortable again.

I have a few questions for this running community, and I'm hoping your experiences can help make my experience even better.

1) Have any of you experienced a pain in the groin/hip flexor area on only one side of your body? 

2) Do any of you have anecdotes as to what might have helped you with your issues? 

3) Could my running form have something to do with this pain? 



I appreciate any help you guys can give me. Resources, anecdotes, and advice are all appreciated. I feel as if this is in an early enough stage where I might be able to address the problem myself. If it continues to get worse, I will definitely seek out a sports physician or other medical expert. 

Thank you,

4583,4583,4583,23,"Nw runner, shoe size question",1598391128,"Hey, 

long story short: I started running regularly a few years ago, stopped running and now I am working on C25k again. I bought some Nike Pegasus to start again. They are comfortable in size, but I am not convinced that they fit well. That’s because my pinky toe on both feet seems to stick out about 1/5 inch (around 0.5cm) of the inner sole, when I land my feet or even stand on my two feet. Therefore I ordered a pair of Hoka Arahi 4, because I seem to be pronating (watched a record of myself), in the size US 11 (or Eu 45 1/3), but the have the same problem as the Nike Pegasus. Otherwise the Pegasus and the Arahi fit very well.

A few years ago, I got a new job and was working 6am-8pm everyday, so running just went out the door and I gained about 20 pounds.)I quit that job about two months ago and started to run again, but found I was having pain at the base of my big toe on the right and running just didn't feel so fluid like it had.

My doctor sent me to a podiatrist where x-rays were done and he examined my foot and toe, but didn't find anything conclusive. He told me to rest for a week or two then try again. I did as he advised, but the pain came back.

Thankfully I mentioned this to my brother in law who was an avid triathlete and runner. He recommended I hit the local running footwear store and get fitted for shoes and insoles. 

OMG! What a life changer that was! They take a scan of your feet, analyze your gait, and started to try on insoles and shoes. Turns out, my feet are super narrow, arches are super high, and the shoes I was wearing were too big. Because of this, my toe was working to grip onto my shoe and therefore, soreness. 

I went for my first run in them today, and it was so enjoyable, pain free, and I can't wait to run tomorrow!

Last month I bought myself a sportwatch so I can properly track my runs. As of lately I started doing interval runs. However, I am not sure whether my interval run is too long/too short or what would be a good interval run for my current pace and goal.

At the moment my aim is to get a better time at the 10km run. Currently I am running 10km at around 5:00 - 5:10 km/hour. Considering my heart rate being around 170 at that pace, this is pretty much the maximum I can go for in a 10km run.

The interval run I've been setting up in my sportwatch:

* 6min warming up
* 500 meter at higher pace (reaching 4:00 km/hour)
* 1min 30sec slowdown
* Repeat the 500 meter higher pace and 1min 30sec slowdown for another six times (so 7 times interval in total)

The 4:00 km/hour I'm reaching during the interval is also the maximum I can go for at the moment.

I was already overweight, and it just got worse. It slowly became so much harder to move with the extra weight that I quit running, and frankly, moving much. I fell headfirst into my eating disorder, and I could feel my body breaking down.

This spiral is devastating because I want to become an ultramarathoner someday (lofty goal for someone like me, I know). But it's all I've wanted for years, yet never had the strength to put in the work.

A week or two ago, I came across a few posts from new runners wanting to fall in love with the sport but not knowing how. Or overweight runners being embarrassed about running in public. And the comments, personal stories &amp; encouragement from y'all kind of lifted me out of the fog I've been living in for five months.

I went for a run that same day. And the next day. And the next. And I stopped eating junk. I bought more vegetables. I drank more water. I started listening to Audiobooks about running again.

I’m still getting that weird feeling in my knee 5 days later, but it’s less now than what it was on Friday. Still no pain at all and I can walk fine, just a weird loose feeling(not even sure if that’s the way to describe it. Could it be related to the IT band?

4602,4602,4602,42,Finally running regularly. Overpronate pretty badly in one foot. I have a question that I can never find a good answer for about foot placement/sensation.,1598377966,"Alright. So Ive been back to running regularly for about a month. Im not fast, but Ive always been good with endurance. My biggest experience with exercise was comptetive dance, and I was fairly strong back in the day. Ive since had a baby and now that he is 2 Im working on losing quite a bit of weight, but my strength has come back pretty quickly. 

I have a feeling my history of dance had a big impact on the areas where my body (feet especially) prioritized muscle strength. My left foot (the base/ push off foot for most turns and kicks) has a good arch and ankle strength.  HOWEVER. I believe that years of leaning on my left foot has caused the outer edge of that foot to splay out. I move around a lot in my left shoe when running, and I struggle getting power out of that toe off. My right foot overpronates pretty badly, but Ive been able to strengthen it quite a bit to the point I have to try to show how it used to roll in OR it will do it when I am going up a hill at an angle. 

Im not here to ask about shoes, but I want to mention what Ive tried. I started in some old Mizunos that I had lying around, probably a full size too small on my right foot. Nasty blister on that heel that Im still working on healing. Then I bought Mizuno Wave Inspire 16s, in my regular shoe size (11 womens) but wide. My left foot started turning in the shoe and I wondered pretty quickly if it was simply too wide. 

I went to a running shoe store and asked for advice. I didnt have a lot of confidence in the sales lady, but she told me I was an 11.5, and that I should get a 12.5 in running shoes. I immediately started telling her I wasnt sure. I was already having problems with the left shoe wiggling around at an 11... but she eventually got me to leave with hokas in a mens 10.5.... I got one mile into my next run and knew it was a mistake. I wasnt even sure I wanted a full blown stability shoe. It seemed like part of the problem in my left foot was that the support on top of the splayed outer side made my foot turn sideways. It was like running in sand, but without being able to adjust your foot without stopping and kicking my heel into place.

I went back to the store and worked with a woman I felt much more confident with and ended up with Saucony guides in 11.5 womens regular width. They are much closer to what I was looking for. More form fitting to my foot and not ""all heels"" as I said many of the other shoes felt. I still feel weird in them to a lesser degree, which is where my actual question comes in (sorry... lol)

When a person without foot imbalances run, either in forefoot, midfoot, or heel strike.... where do you feel the pressure as your foot moves through the motion? My assumption is that with 2 balanced, strong feet, you would hit at whatever starting point but the foot would stay activated in the ball of the foot and you would push off with pressure mostly in your big toe and maybe the second. If proper running shoe fitting is to size up, how could anyone get their toes to the right part of the shoe to get that traction with the ground? Do runners with neutral shoes move around in the toe box and heel as well? Is there some phenomenon where a properly strong foot would simply keep its good form without spreading or moving in a loose shoe and it not cause problems?

Im mostly looking for experiences from runners without arch problems and those who have overcome them. Every shoe/insert and tweaks to my form Ive tried always seems to negatively affect one or the other foot. In fact, I experimented with taping the ball of my left foot, or stuffing that shoe to hold my foot in place, and I almost feel like im not even fully activating that leg when I run with the looser shoe. Its like my right foot is dragging my left along, because I lose any power from the left when I roll past the ball of my foot and over the side of my big toe.

31(M), 182cm/80kg or 6'/176lbs. Almost zero experience in running 5 weeks ago except for the occasional treadmill warm-up at the gym and some random jogs here and there. Some cycling, swimming and other sports couple times a week, not in bad shape but just really an average dude. 

**Story**

So 5 weeks ago I ambitiously and perhaps foolishly decided I was going to run a sub 2 hour HM in late October. This gave me a window of 12 weeks to get ready. I googled training programs and found a good one. Long runs, tempo, intervals, hills, easy 5k's and a few checkpoint-type races - it had it all. For the past 4,5 weeks I've followed that program religiously,  stretching and foam rolling every evening, eating clean and sleeping 8 hours a night- really trying my best to achieve that goal. I track my runs carefully and I focus on maintaining an 80-20 balance (80% really easy, 20% really hard) in my training. I've seen some gradual improvement, most notably I can now jog and my HR stays in zone 2. When I started even a brisk walk would make my HR shoot to zone 3. 

Anyway, today my program called for a solo 5k race, the first real test on my way to the HM. I wasn't really feeling it, awful day at work and a lot of stuff to do but hey, no excuses! Running shoes on and after a little warm-up off I went. I chose to run on a nearby road with some uphills (btw those ended up killing me).

**1k 04:50**

**2k 05:27**

**3k 05:32**

**4k 05:53**

**5k 05:50**

So I started way too fast and after the first k I was dying. I slowed down but maybe not enough. At the halfway mark I was thinking about quitting but thought about Goggins and asked myself WHO'S GONNA CARRY THE FUC\*\*\* BOATS. Kept going. For the last 2k I wasn't able to push myself any harder and I was in complete survival mode. Got to the 5k mark and checked my time: 27:36. An immediate wave of disappointment hit me. I wanted to run a sub 25 min and this was way off. I suck. I'm never going to make it. I should just quit running. Everybody on Reddit runs sub 20's, this is embarrassing. 

As I walked home disheartened I checked my old runs and realized that this was the fastest I've ever run a 5k. Actually by over 16 minutes. Actually it was the first time I ever truly ran a 5k period. Actually if I ran at that pace in my HM I would crush my goal! And I still had 7 weeks to go before the race, plenty of time, I can do this! Actually I am the greatest runner in the world! 

A few hours have now passed and I'm somewhere between feeling like a complete failure and Kipchoge in Vienna.

Because of covid, whenever I pass someone, I step off of the sidewalk and a bit into the road, just to make sure people have plenty of space because I don't wear a mask when I run. The last thing I want to do is make people uncomfortable. People usually wave and say thank you or good morning. But one particular woman was NOT having it. She was on the sidewalk, coming up the street while I was going down. I did what I usually do, kept my distance and headed out into the road (safely). As I approached her, she forcefully pointed away from her. I assumed she needed even more space so I stopped and waited for some cars to pass before I headed out farther into the road. Then she lost it, and screamed ""CROSS THE F\*\*\*ING ROAD!!"" I was absolutely stunned, and crossed. Technically, she was on the wrong side of the road, I was on the correct side and she made me cross onto the wrong side. If she didn't want to cross, she could have moved onto the grass on the other side of the sidewalk if she felt that she needed more space. She also **wasn't wearing a mask**.

I have since moved and run by myself 99.99% of the time. I don't feel safe running alone at night so I haven't used it in almost 2 years, but I hope to one day get the confidence to run in the evening again.

That’s mainly because I never thought I’d be capable to run 10k or even less with my damaged knee. I’m 31, F, and when 18 I was hit by a car while crossing the street (on a zebra crossing). Most of the impact went directly into my right knee. I was was out of commission for half a year, undergoing surgery and then in rehabilitation for two years or so.Since then I have stayed fairly active which was encouraged by doctors but did not think I would ever be able to run long distances. Few months back I gave it a go and have been running ever since but in the back of my head I still cannot help but feel that with my injury there’s no point in dreaming of running a marathon. Even after 10k I feel good deal of pain in my right knee. I do recovery, exercise to strengthen the leg muscles especially around the knee which was recommended to me but I don’t know if this is a situation in which perseverance can help me reach my goal.

It was hard, hilly, and a little hot, but I made it. I had brought a bottle of electrolyte drink with me and pounded the water bottle and ate some salty snacks when I got in the door. I went about the rest of my day feeling pretty much fine, if a little tired and sore. I went to bed at midnight.

At 1:30 AM I woke up running to the bathroom to vomit my brains out. I got up twice more during the night to do the same thing until I was dry heaving. I wound up sleeping on the couch to be closer to the bathroom. The next day I was totally fatigued and dehydrated and had no appetite (I honestly thought I might have COVID but had no fever, no respiratory symptoms, no loss of senses). All I could do literally all day was lie down feeling super sore and fatigued. I forced down water and smoothies and saltines, but I felt like crap literally all day. I only finally feel better this morning (probably about 90% now).

So, what happened to me? Is this something others have experienced after a strenuous run? I'm wondering if it wasn't just a weird correlation of events — possibly lingering dehydration from the long-run plus food poisoning or a 24-hour flu = severe dehydration the next day (no one else in my household got food poisoning so that would be a little odd)? Or do long runs just mess up your body sometimes? I've never experienced anything like this so I'd appreciate some insight or some info on how I can avoid messing myself up in the future.

I’ll dive right in with some background info and what I’m trying to accomplish / am struggling with finding the right balance.

I have asthma and ADHD. I play soccer once a week (I’m old now, so it’s rec), and have always struggled with being winded because I never really ran for fun and thought it’s absurd. Well, its pretty fun to say. 

The issue I’m having is the mornings, as running at night keeps me awake. I like to wake up, chug a glass of water, walk a dog with my wife at 5, come home, meditate and then jog another dog at 6:30 when the sun rises (get that vitamin D amirite?).

I don’t want to eat before running, I like to FEAST after. But food affects my adhd medication and its absorption drastically. I’ve been playing with my routine a lot and can’t quite tweak it right (I’m sure the answer is right in front of me). 

Taking my medication at 5 on an empty stomach with just water is best. But then I crash sooner and it can be dangerous exercising on adderall (my heart rate sometimes goes nuts when I have, I bought l-arginine to see if it would help?).

If I go jogging, come home at 7, eat my big meal at 7:10 and as I’ve been playing with the times and I need like two hours to take my meds or I just don’t feel them as well and start my work day all over the place and it’s hard to reel myself back in.

My husband and I don't have children, but my best friend and her 3 kiddos moved in with us in May after her abusive husband took his own life (long story fit for a different sub). They are great kids and doing super well considering the circumstances, and recently the youngest who is an almost eight year old boy asked me if he could start coming with me on my ""marathons"" (LOL I run like 2.9 miles most days). He is the ""outdoor kid"" of the bunch, and he reminds me of how I was when I was little. He has a LOT of energy but also has a healthy sense of competition and is naturally driven and tenacious. He loves to run fast - we race often and he can almost beat me when I run full tilt. Moderation and self control are not his strong suit yet, but we are working on it.

I may be taking things too seriously, but I really feel that this kid needs a healthy outlet for his energy and would love to help instill in him a love for running (or some other active sport). Him mom and sibs are more on the ""indoor kid"" spectrum so they encourage him but aren't into the same activities. We have made it around the block (\~1/4 mile) using a stoplight system -""green light"" means run fast, ""yellow light"" means jog, and he can call ""red light"" any time he needs to walk - with the only rule being that we do our best not to stop moving during the session. Does anyone have any things they've done with their kids to make running fun and interesting? It bears mentioning that I do my serious runs on his rest days, and his runs on mine so I am not worried about exercise, just about his experience.

I've given a shot at running a couple of times in my life, but never really kept going for more than a couple of months. This year however i've been running since January.

4697,4697,4697,41,"Self-proclaimed ""slow runner"" finally broke 30:00 in the 5k",1598305369,"I started running with Couch to 5k when I was in middle school, because I was tired of not being able to run down the block. I was slow, but I improved my endurance to the point where I could run for three hours (11.5 miles, but still). It was frustrating to be passed by run-walkers during the local 5k, but I was proud to finish: 12:51 pace! I adopted the identity of a ""slow runner"" and doubted that I'd ever break 30:00.

I joined cross country my freshman year of high school and ran an average of 11:22 for a 2.8 mile course. The next year, my PR was a 5k at 11:41 pace. That was my last season of XC, thought I kept myself moving with road biking and rowing.

Two years later, in the fall of 2017, I averaged 10:52 for a local 5k. Two years after *that*, after walking onto my college's rowing team, I averaged 10:02 for a 5k (PR'ed during a 4 mile run). When crew got cancelled this spring, I applied the intensity it had taught me to running. The past few months, I've PR'ed multiple times in the mile, 5k, 10k, and half marathon, and I even ran my longest run (20 miles!). 

Today, in 65 **°** F and 95% humidity, I broke 30! I huffed and puffed my way to a 29:39 5k (average 9:33), knocking almost 50 seconds off my previous PR from early June. I keep seeing people running at my pace on Strava, and it's starting to sink in that while I'm not winning races against anyone else, I'm not so much of a ""slow runner"" anymore. 

So for my fellow ""slow runners"" -- stick with it! It took me 7 years, but I finally achieved something I thought I just wasn't cut out to do. The key was learning to push myself. Collegiate rowing raised the bar for the kind of discomfort my mind and body can sustain. From 2013-2017, I was running hard on race day, but I wasn't training hard enough throughout the week. (I used to run the same 4 mile route every day at around the same pace! No wonder I broke up with running for a few months in eighth grade.) Lately, I've been pushing myself to hold moderate pace for 4 and 5 mile runs (that's 11:00 miles for me), and I've thrown in some track workouts (1 minute sprints or 400m repeats) to spice things up. It keeps things interesting, and it's making me faster!

Hey everyone. I just ran four miles for the first time in over two months, but I'm not feeling great about it. At the beginning of quarantine and through about June, I was running 4-7 miles without a problem, but in the past couple of months I've found myself getting really tired after only about two miles. During this recent four miler, I had to stop every half mile to drink some water and catch my breath, which meant I finished the run at a very slow pace (about 12:00/mile). I averaged about 10:00/mile in the past. I've been chalking up the increased exhaustion and difficulty to the summer heat; I live in Chicago, and we've had a pretty hot, humid summer (like mid-upper 80s everyday). I'm really hoping that once it cools down I'll be able to get back into it, as I really feel terrible when I have to slow down or stop after only a couple of miles. It makes me feel like I'm crazy out of shape or something is wrong with me, since I KNOW I can do (and have done) better. There's nothing worse than setting out to accomplish something and not being able to do it.

I feel like this four mile run should have been way easier/faster, or I should have been able to go farther for longer. Has anyone experiences a rut like this? Where you just, for some reason, CAN'T do what you know you can do? How did you cope with it? What mental barriers did you have to break? I'm feeling really down on myself about this.

Additionally, I've been trying to supplement my workout routines since running has been so difficult lately. I've been doing a lot of Youtube full-body workouts (Pamela Reif, Chloe Ting) as well as HIIT with a jumprope, but I wonder if there's other exercises I can do to improve my running?

Following up from my last post. The last month has definitely had it's issues. The heat/humidity of late July through August sapped the energy in my legs, and my will to continue.

I have noticed an interesting pattern that has developed. The first week and a half or so of the month is miserable, the extra mile seems to take forever, then somewhere around week 3 my body gets it's act together and I feel terrific, and the last week of the month is usually spent wishing I could just increase the mileage already.

If anyone has questions I'll be answering in between naps today. Hopefully see you in a month.

About me: 

A/S: 33/F   
Longest run: 14.1 miles  
Current avg weekly miles: 23  
5k PR: 28:36  
10k PR: 59:55

(tl;rd I run slow)  
Gear: Brooks Ghost 12 and Brooks Ghost 13  
Current goal: Get my half down closer to 2hrs before an event coming up in October.

My Story:  
I joined a gym about a year and 3 months ago to just get into better shape overall. I'd work out about 5 days per week alternating between cardio (usually on an elliptical) and weight lifting. Eventually I got bored with being on an elliptical and switched to running/jogging on the treadmill. They were less frequently occupied than ellipticals. I was terrible at running in high school and had never completed a mile without stopping. I decided I was going to do that. I did and decided to just keep going eventually getting up to around 4.5 miles in my 1 hour sessions at the gym. 

When I started running more 'seriously' I went to my local running store to get fitted for some decent running shoes. I had been having knee pains and I thought maybe my cross-training shoes may have been the problem and if I was going to increase my miles it would be even more important to take care of my body. My knee problems persisted for a little while after that but did eventually clear up. All good on that front now. 

The Rona happened and I didn't want to lose all of my progress up until that point so I decided to keep running on the trails near my house. It kept me sane while we were in quarantine since we didn't really leave the house except to get groceries. I was racking up more and more miles with ease. However this is where my problems began. 

I started getting a callus on the middle toe of my left foot. It never really hurt... it was just rough and kind of crusty looking. Not cute but nothing an at home pedicure every now and then wouldn't fix. I assumed this was just part of the running life. 

One night about 2 months ago I ran 11 miles in one session and I decided what's a couple more miles... It's time to do a half marathon! So I did. It was a disaster which could be a whole separate thread about what not to do on your first half but that's for another time. 

Since then I've been doing weekly half marathons. Aside from feeling really wiped around mile 11 or 12 or the occasional side stitch I never feel any pain. This is where my toenail problems kicked into high gear. 

About 3 weeks ago I went back to the running store (same local chain but different location than before) to make sure my shoes were properly fitted, get a new pair of shoes, and what else I could do to prevent the loss of my toenails.  They had me run on a treadmill but said they didn't see anything wrong with my form. They found no issues with the way my shoes fit. The only recommendation was to change the way I had my shoes laced at the top (by the ankle). I moved the laces to the holes closer to my ankles to make the opening smaller and maybe assist in keeping my feet 'back' in the shoes in case my feet were sliding forward and my toes were rubbing on the front of the shoes. They also suggested changing my socks. I had been mostly running in cheap, lightweight athletic socks I got at walmart but in the week or two prior I had purchased a pair of lightweight smartwool athletic socks.

Currently my my middle left toenail has receded about half way up the nail bed. My middle right toenail is almost totally detached from the nail bed. I can't tell if there's a new nail growing underneath. The toenail to the right of that (4th toenail?) gets blisters underneath the nail bed/at the tip of the toe all the time. They never hurt during or after my runs. They just look atrocious. 

Is the next step going to see a doctor? Try a different type of shoe? The guy at the running store said for some people sometimes toenails and running just aren't compatible. Is that true? Would wrapping my toes in some sort of athletic tape help? Tape them to each other? Wear some kind of extra cushiony barrier between my toe and shoe? Would it be beneficial to have someone observe my running form w/o shoes on? Am I just running too much (this seems unlikely)?

I bounce between being sad that I have such ugly toes and wearing them as a badge of honor because of what I've accomplished and how far I've come. But as I'm writing this I'm definitely more in the sad camp. :(

I run casually in general but only this year, I've started taking it a bit more seriously - adding more miles and days to the running. And started to observe my form closely too.

Couple things about me:

\-I have (mild to medium?) **bow legs**. Photo in the link.

\-I'm generally a healthy 28yr old male. No serious health issues or anything. I exercise regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

[REFERENCE TO THE VIDEO AND PHOTO LINK.](https://imgur.com/a/5Pp4txc)

After intense running weeks, **my right leg usually gets more sore than my left leg** \- specifically my left Achilles and calf. My left leg is barely sore compared to my right - which gets me to think that I would like to run even more miles and days but sometimes my right leg restricts me from doing so.

I didn't realize this until I took the photo, but it does seem like my right bow leg is more severe than my left leg. And it's very apparent **in the video**, that clearly I'm **not landing my feet neutrally straight down looking at my calf to my ankle.** But because of my bow leg, I couldn't make my leg connect straight to my ankle when running even if I wanted to.

I've looked up many stretches and exercises online for straightening out bow legs but I've never seen real testimonies or results that actually worked.. I've even started running barefoot cause some people say that's another method which has given me some blisters so I've been in and out of doing that. Is this something I can actually fully fix if not at least alleviate?

4726,4726,4726,70,Hip Arthroscopy for Labral tear / FAI - experiences?,1598287608,"37/m hoping to share this story about my experience so far with hip arthroscopy &amp; learn more about the experiences of other runners who have had it in the past.

For years I struggled with a hamstring tendinopathy and started rowing very vigorously on an erg as my running volume decreased. I started having increasing pain along the lateral side of my hip, and my sports medicine doc waived it away, telling me to have the PT add in some hip work instead of just the hamstring.

Well, the hamstring resolved, but the hip got worse and worse. My doc did a labral tear test and said I likely didn't have a tear, as I'd be screaming in pain with the way that he was manipulating the hip. 4-5 months of physical therapy later, my hip was no better--I would have some better weeks and some worse ones, constantly in pain. I got a cortisone shot in the hip but it didn't help at all. And it was almost as if my PT was shaming me for being frustrated at my lack of progression. Well, Covid hit and my 6+ month of PT sessions and dry needling were cancelled. I was relieved. My first doc sent me to someone who specializes in runners with arthritis (associated faculty at Harvard and doc for the BAA Marathon). He said my x-rays didn't indicate progressed arthritis, tried a cortisone shot outside the joint (psoas) which didn't provide relief. We did a special hip MRI that could show a labral tear, and after a whole year of my first doc and PT telling me I didn't have a labral tear or that if I did, it didn't matter as many runners have labral tears, the MRI report indicated a tear a mixed-type impingement, and the doc finally referred me to a surgeon, since he knew how frustrated I was and that I was in pain all the time.

The surgeon said that the MRI was no better than looking into someone's window with binoculars from a mile away, and that he wouldn't really know what was happening in the hip until he was actually inside it, and that it was my choice whether or not to have the surgery. I told him I was tired of the pain, hadn't run in years, and wanted to get things moving forward. This was all during Covid, and my surgery was scheduled for July. After a negative Covid test, got the surgery done. When I woke up in the recovery, I asked the surgeon what he found in there. He said I had a huge labral tear from the 12o'clock position to the 9o'clock position (so, like, 75%), that they used three anchors to repair the tear, and shaved off the impingement.

The last few weeks have been really up and down. There are some days when the hip feels surprisingly okay (even though I'm on crutches and was told to keep them for a full six-weeks post-op), but mostly the same pain has returned. At my first follow-up (10 days) I mentioned this, and was told that I just had a huge surgery, that my tear was significant, and that I was in for a very long recovery and have probably just been overdoing things (which might be true). But now that I'm five weeks post surgery, some days the pain is just ridiculously frustrating.

Reading this subreddit, I learned that like every other newbie, I overdo it, and I should run slower.  Been doing that for about a month.  But I've recently come across some data indicating I might still be overdoing it.

29M 6'4"" 170lbs 14% body fat (was 223lbs after college with a physique that didn't match my self-image, spent the last 5 years keeping my calorie intake slightly lower than my basically sedentary output, been stable at this weight for ~6 months, increased my food consumption when I started running), unclear on my fitness level.  Both my job and hobby involve using a computer, and that's at least 12 hours a day, so I'm basically sedentary except for when I purposely exercise.

So, I've been treadmill running ~30 minutes at a 12 minute pace, 2-3 times a week, for probably three weeks.  I did 40 minutes once.  I did an 11 minute pace once.  Both were fun.  I also just bought a garmin forerunner 245.  (My fitbit died two weeks ago.)  At the end of the run, I'm extremely sweaty but generally feel like I could go a bit further.  I've been purposely holding back because this subreddit told me to, and because I've phrased my goal as ""be a runner"", rather than any particular performance target.  The exception is that when I haven't eaten enough lately (lockdown/WFH life is somewhat irregular), I am really really glad the exercise is over at the end.

So, medical advice is NOT what I'm asking for.  I'm a weird person; I'm like 99.5%-ile for my ability to learn technical things about computers, but I'm super bad at learning more normal things, like being social or how my body works.  E.g. I have trouble telling when I'm hungry sometimes, though e.g. I *really* like pizza, so it balances out.  I learn these things by watching how other people behave.  And that's what I'm looking for -- your experiences.

I just had a friend ask me if I'm like this guy -- https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/aug/30/dean-karnazes-man-run-forever -- when I told them that I can run 14 flights of stairs before I experience muscle failure, and that I feel out of breath, but basically fine at that point.  I.e. no burning in my legs.  I mentioned it to another friend, and they told me to do 90-degree-knee squats, until failure, and report on how it felt.  I noticed a temperature increase in my legs after 3, respiration increase at 20, and my rate slowed ~20% after about 30.  Similar slowing was noticed every 15 or so, until I lost count at 70.  I think I did 20-30 more after that, before I decided I was done (could have done more), at which point it took my full attention to walk without falling.

4735,4735,4735,79,Concerned about my heart rate,1598282658,"Hi everyone,

I started to run for the first time (I’m 34) in January 2020. Well let’s say actually that I started a physical activity for the first time for 15 years. 5ft10 for 175 lbs. The goal is to improve my physical condition which looks pretty poor according to my running performances. As you could expect the first runs were disastrous / hilarious as I hardly finished a 2 miles run without walking. Now I’m starting to get a bit better and even if my pace is very slow (around 11min/mile) I manage to run a bit more without stopping.

So after this short introduction I would like to ask you if I should be worried about my heart rate.

It seems that my max is around 190 and yesterday after trying to increase my pace I ran for 2.5 miles @180+ and even if it decreased at 130 quickly after I stopped, I kinda stagned at 120 for 1 hour and a half.

I’m a bit hipochondrial and I wondered if this kind of situations were « normal » for someone who is not sporty. Also I wanted to ask what will be the first signals that my condition is improving. Is it a lower heart rate for the same effort? A faster recovery ? Lower idle heart rate?

Last but not least, for improving this, I read that long runs mixed with internal trainings are the best. Is it true even for hard beginners ?

**TL;DR - I went for a run too late, it was pitch black on a semi-secluded mixed-use path, I was alone, I thought I was being followed, I was miles from my car. Please remember to bring a light and a phone with you when you run alone.**

Until they officially cancel Ironman Florida, I have to keep training so I'm prepared. As with almost all of their other races we won't be told until under 45 days out. I rode \~100 miles (160 km) yesterday and needed a long run today. I slept most of the day except for eating, stretching, and relaxing. Around 6:30pm I started to get ready so I could be done before dinner. In my head - ""It's been pretty light outside until 9pm lately so I should be fine."" Well, I keep my phone on military time - just something I've always done even though I'm not military. Turns out I am stupid it was really 7:30pm because I glanced at my phone incorrectly and maybe I was more tired than usual. So by the time I made it to the local mixed-use path it was just after 8pm.

I thought I would get a half marathon in by running \~4 miles (6.5 km) to a stop, 2 more miles out to turn around and come back to the stop, 4 miles back to the car, and then whatever else I needed to finish up. I ran to the 4-mile stop fine not really thinking anything of how much light was out because there were lots of people on the path still, but when I came out of the bathroom at the 4-mile stop it became immediately clear I had misjudged things because it was very dark all of the sudden.

I decided to forego running out to my turnaround and just head back from there. As soon as I was away from the stop it was incredibly dark and I could barely see anything because the path is lined with trees/woods on both sides pretty much the entire way. There are some houses near the path, but they're just far enough away that they don't provide any light. And probably just far enough away that no one would hear you scream.

And the fact that I was completely alone, with no phone or light, just out of earshot from anyone was all I thought about the entire time I ran back. There were a few random sidewalk entrances here and there, but I felt really stupid about walking up on a stranger or knocking on a door half naked to explain that I had no phone, had no light, had no mask, was afraid of the dark, and needed to call someone to come get me. 

With every passing signpost, bench, curve, tunnel, or large tree I would ball my fists and raise them up to my chest. I felt so dumb the entire time running back, but people have died on the path. There is a cross planted on the side some miles out reminding us about a woman who was alone and pulled off the path.

I was running around 8 min/mi (5 min/km) on the way out but on the way back I was going much faster. I ended up running around 35 minutes out and 30 minutes back, so cut 5 minutes from my time over \~4 miles (6.5 km). I kept looking over my shoulder to make sure no one was behind me but there was never anyone there. Except for when I saw some small lights approaching very slowly. They were fairly far back, but they looked like they were keeping the same distance. I started to get really freaked out. Then I noticed the lights weren't actually moving. They path was just so straight I could see all the way back to the last small crossing and they were stationary there. A sigh of relief a little bit. Until a mile later when the lights were now moving and were getting slowly closer and closer. Once they got close enough, I stopped running and just stood on the side of the path trying to prepare myself for anything. A really nice family of three riding their bikes and listening to music slowly pedaled by with some dim lights on the front of their bikes. I immediately tried to run their biking pace, but it was just fast enough that I couldn't keep up.

I made it back to my car, but it's going to be quite a while before I think I'm comfortable running at night again even with a light and phone. I should have done a lot of things differently in retrospect. But in the moment I just wanted to be home and kept running so I could get in my car and leave.

I started getting this swelling after I put my shoes in the wash and my shoes haven’t been right ever since. I think the tightness of the shoes due to the swelling of the soles and my distance running has created this problem. It’s been a few months and there doesn’t seem to be any progress in the swelling going down.

It’s not painful to the touch and walking but when weight is put on my heels, such as when I’m on my chair and I have my foot on my desk, when I raise it there is some pain.

Went to physiotherapist and podiatrist and couldn’t diagnose the problem.

My running gait is bad as told by my podiatrist. My shoes are for overpronators. I never had such a problem before I washed my shoes. 
I never stretch and I am muscular due to being at the gym. Small calves but massive everything else. Very tight muscles. 

It really doesn’t look like if I were to puncture it, any fluid would come out because it feels like a swollen muscle or ligament, not a fluid sac like a ganglion cyst.

4749,4749,4749,93,Lifelong powerlifter and thicc boi beginner Q,1598272351,"33 y/o next week and deciding to join the Air Force. 

I was a champion powerlifter and recreational bodybuilder for a long time. I also smoked until this year. And never did cardio. The epitome of health, certainly. I developed my body to be entirely anaerobic.

I did train for MMA/Boxing but never competed. So some cardio there but not to my fullest potential.

A while ago I decided I'd be enlisting soon. So I started losing weight. I wasn't fat and weighed 210 at 5'9. Now about 175 with no fat left to lose. 

Well I couldn't go one lap without nearly dying at around 200 lbs. I tried to run a little further each time but plateaued very fast. 

I learned that a progressive routine helps. Much like with strength training. Here's my routine 

3 days/wk. 30 minutes total

Wk 1: Run 2 mins, walk 3 mins

Wk 2: Run 3 mins, walk 2 mins

Wk 3: Run 4 mins, walk 1.5 mins

Wk 5: Run 5 mins, walk 1 min

Wk 6: Run 6 mins, walk 1 min.  *I am here*


So for the air force, the test is a 1.5 mile run in under 11 minutes. More speed and less distance of course.

I'm concerned that this routine is ruining my pace for the test.

When I could run for 4 minutes it would be just under 2 laps. When I could run for 5 minutes it was exactly 2 laps. Now at 6 minutes I'm at maybe 2.10 laps.. 

I'm able to run for longer comfortably. But my distance isn't improving. And distance x time seems to be getting worse...

At the start of 2020 I quit Orange Theory and started running outside in hopes of running a half marathon in May. Race was canceled so I ran a virtual half. Race was then moved to September so I decided to train for a full.

The race was cancelled yet again about a month ago, so I came on this forum and asked if I should run a virtual full.  A lot of people said I should wait to an actual race because running a full is a big accomplishment that should be celebrated. Someone stated that they were going to run a marathon on there birthday. It gave me an idea. I was turning 37 on August 22 so I was going to run 37 km on my 37th birthday. I was going to save the full distance for my first race. 

So I started at 7am on Saturday. I parked at the park by my house. I ran the first half east out and back along the Lakefront trail.  I refiled my water bottles that I left in my car and then ran west for the second half out and back along the same trail.

I was never concerned about time. My goal marathon pace is 10 min mile but I was aiming at 10.30/  mile for this run which is my long run pace. I finished at 10.35/mile so I was a little off. However, my last mile was 9.55 and I had energy at the end so I know I could push myself a little more if I had too.

I thought i'd at least shoot for an average goal pace which was 10:15. I hung in there with no problems until mile 21 where I stopped for about 10 seconds to fill up a water bottle. After filling it up and standing still for a couple of seconds, I physically could not make my legs run. I could only hobble. After questioning throwing in the towel, I hobbled for a mile until I could... somewhat run again. I ran and walked on and off until finishing well past all of time goals. 

I'm going on Hal Hidgon's program starting next week and I can't wait to see how much I will have improved. But for now I'm just happy to have finished frankly.

Anyway, here's my pace graph:

## Background/ Training

33m, 6'3 90kgs. Took running seriously as of this year. Couldnt get under 25mins for 5k at the start of the year. Running about 50ks a week. Mostly easy 10-12k runs, with a speed set or tempo on tuesday. I dont really have a long run date, I've done a couple of 15ks here and there.

After hitting big 5 and 10k PB's I thought I'd try my hand at the half, set a benchmark. With our 2nd baby arriving soon and summer approaching. I can't see myself improving for the next little while.

I did a half time trial solo in 1:53 back in may. I know I've improved a lot since then.  I had a goal of 1:40, but really just wanted to hit every k under 5 mins and set a time. I think I didn't want to absolutely flog myself,  would save that for whenever I get to do an actual race leave a bit in the tank for a  stronger finish. Last time I did the half I started out in 5:05 pace, ended up at about 5:45.

## Pre-race

The course I chose was 7 and a bit laps around a lake near me. It's quite nice to run, though has a few twists and rolling little hills.  I thought I'd choose it so I can put out a few cups of gatorade at a table and grab one each lap. Plus I wouldn't have to bother about measuring out a course.

I woke up at 5, had an espresso GU, tasted a bit funny but ok (new flavour for me). Was about to head out the door and realized my watch had little battery.  Big fail! I ended up driving to the lake while charging my watch and proceeded to do my warm up while still charging the watch on a portable charger.

Did 1 k warm up with a few drills, leg swings, lunges, set out some cups of gatorade grabbed my watch which was up to 24% by now, hopped that was enough and took off.

## Kilometers [1] to [5]

It took a while to get the pacing right, I wanted to hit around 4:45-4:55 pace give or take. Not a pace I run at very often. My tempo is around 4:25-4:30 these days, easy runs around 5:15-5:45. Once I got there, I think I felt still a bit stiff and tight. Plus my shoe on my right foot was a bit loose, I could feel it sliding around. Do I stop and tighten in? No I decided to press on.

Felt though I was working a bit harder than I wanted to be and had some doubts over the sustainability of this pace.

I grabbed a gatorade cup at the 3k mark, which I had to make a slight deviation for and then I didnt really think it through, the cups I had were quite large and hard to drink from. Plus I had made it way too strong.

## Kilometers [6] to [10]

I started to feel good now pace wise, settled into a good rhythm. Until suddenly, I look down and my shoelaces are undone on my right foot! I press pause on my watch and tighten and double knot them on both feet. I probably make them a bit too tight and hope that continue to run will break them back in. I lose about a minute in doing that as well...

I'm able to quickly get back into a rhythm and the shoes do feel better after about half a k.

I grab another gatorade as well after lap 2, my stomach feels a bit funny. Maybe I'll just do every 2nd lap now on.

## Kilometers [11] to [15]

Hitting the halfway mark was a big boost. It's downhill from here. Well each k has a bit of up and down hill, hence a bit more variance than if it was all flat. I start producing a bit of phlegm, which I'm a bit conscious of during COVID 19. I make sure I spit in quiet bushy areas...  Not sure what the ettiqute is there...

Still feeling pretty good, legs a little heavy. I'm breathing in 2 steps out 2 steps.

## Kilometers [16] to [21.1]

As expected things get a bit tough here. I'm hanging out fro the last 5k and then the last 3k lap. Except it's a 2.88km course, so it's hard to predict when the last full lap will be. I try and do some calculations in my head to distract me. When I get to 5k to go, I feel relieved. But then i realize 5k is still a long way to go. It's 23-24 minutes of running!

I have a bit of an energy boost from somewhere (probably the gatorade) at the 18k mark, run a 4:33. But then I start puffing and realize I've got 3ks still to go... I thought maybe I could push for each of the last few k's but I cant keep this up. So I relax a bit and tell myself, stay steady and save it for the last k. That's basically what I do- I launch for the last k end up doing a 4:18 which I'm pretty happy with.

Final time is sub 1:40! But then when I add my shoe lace time, it blows back out.

All in all, I'm pretty happy and with another block of training next year and flat race conditions maybe could get close to 1:30.

## What's next?

Baby is due in a week and will have to cut back running a bit, especially as family cant visit due to COVID state borders closed.  Next year I want to run a marathon, maybe 3:30 could be a goal, depending on what shape I'm in, but even just finishing one I'd be stoked. I also want to see if I can get  a sub 40 10k.",running,reformedpolak,False,/r/running/comments/ifjb1s/140_half_this_morning_13_minute_pr/

[Virtual Race Teaser](https://youtu.be/6hOza0OOS8s)

This is a pretty interesting concept for a virtual race.

What I think sets this apart from all other virtual races I've seen so far is that it offers a ""virtual tour"" of the entire course from start to finish with past footage of previous years races.

Most virtual races will offer bling and a shirt but it is really missing the entire race experience which I think this might be able to provide.

4775,4775,4775,20,Virtual Race Tips - Especially for Tracking Distance,1598239215,"Sorry if this has been posted a lot recently. I’m still pretty new to half-marathons (handful under my belt, but still feel like a newbie) and would like to solicit advice on tips/tricks specifically for doing them virtually since almost all advice I’ve seen is for in-person races. I‘m not one for fancy gear (no special watches or cool water bottle backpacks, and I rarely walk with my phone) and I don’t really want to drop serious cash on items I’d seldom use. But...

- Virtual races are asking me to submit screenshots of my course and time from an app, but I’ve never used an app to track before. My times have ranged from 3:05-3:45 in previous races, so I’m concerned about my phone dying halfway through. For people who run/walk 3+ hours—what apps do y’all use to map your courses and verify timing? Do you carry a spare battery charger to plug in half-way?

- I have 3 half marathons that all got rescheduled to within 4 weeks of each other before they were just recently cancelled and went virtual. The window to submit times overlaps, so the best I could do was spread them 3 weeks apart. (Race X is in 3 weeks, then Race Y is 3 weeks later, and Race Z is 3 weeks after Y). On my original plan, I taper the 3 weeks before a race. So should I stick to that same “taper” mileage between Races X-Y and Y-Z? Max distance is only a 7 miler, so I’m concerned I’ll lose conditioning, but also that I might wear myself out packing in more mileage. 

- I live in a somewhat dense suburban area, so there are always people on the prime paths/trails I want to take for my virtual races. I’d feel more comfortable wearing a mask for safety reasons, but masks are so uncomfortable when they’re sticking to your face and preventing you from taking deep breaths. I’ve been suffering through, putting on a fresh one halfway into my walks and separating from my walking buddy and passerby when I absolutely have to suck in air. Please tell me someone has found the holy grail of buffs or bandanas to overcome this?

- Lastly, for those who have already done their virtual races, or those who do longer runs/walks — what are some tips for staying motivated, staying hydrated without carrying a gallon jug, staying safe going solo, music or podcast recommendations, etc?

This is a tall order, so any help is appreciated.  Thanks in advance!",running,aknomnoms,False,/r/running/comments/ifhd5k/virtual_race_tips_especially_for_tracking_distance/

This weekend, I virtually ran the Eastern States 20 Miler, a race that was to start in Maine and end in Massachusetts via New Hampshire's 18-mile Atlantic coastline. The event, normally held in late-March, is informally regarded as a warm-up race for the Boston Marathon and is the longest race I've run to date.

### Training
Training was originally in the January/February time frame for the end-of-March race. I did two long runs (18.1 miles and 15 miles) along with regular practice runs and was also participating in a weekly 5K series during the winter months.

This summer they finally announced the event would be held virtually with an option to defer for a discounted entry fee next year. I was on the fence but decided to do the virtual run. Training basically consisted of a virtual half marathon race on July 4 (new PR) and a 10 mile run two weeks after that, giving me a full month to recover for the race.

### Pre-race
I took it easy in the week leading up to the race, going for a couple of 5K runs and doing an easy 2 mile shake-out run the morning before. I ate 400g of carbs (A 60% macro percentage) the day before the race, making sure to have an early dinner. I ate a bagel and drank some water at 4:30am on race day.

### Race
Since running the original, coastal route would not have been practical during the busy beach season, I mapped a point-to-point course beginning in my home town, crossing into a neighboring town and then coming back and ending in a different part of town. The first 2 miles were a quick 350' descent from the hilly side of town. I chose this to help offset some bigger elevation gains later on. As I run a 6:40-6:50/mile 5K, I thought it would be reasonable to start at my best half marathon pace of 7:50/mile before throttling back, despite sacrificing chances for negative splits. Around mile 4.5, now running 8:30-8:40 miles up a gradual but steady incline, I began occasional refueling with candy corn (which I like for its easy chewing and being almost entirely sugar). Things continued around that same pace through mile 7-8, when I stopped to pick up the first of two disposable water bottles I'd stashed along the route. I walked and chugged water and then resumed running, keeping the water bottle with me for occasional sips.

Going into mile 12 on my way back home, my pace inched above 9:00/mile where it remained for the rest of the race. I stopped for my second water bottle a little before mile 13, chugged maybe 6 ounces and continued on at paces approaching 9:30. I did not feel thirsty but in retrospect there were obvious signs of dehydration. My smartwatch showed a continuous, gradual heart rate increase during those miles as my pace slowed down. At mile 17, I briefly throttled down to walking before picking up speed and gaining a little steam. I completed miles 19 and 20 at 9:16 each, for a final time of 2:57:59, accomplishing my 3:00 goal time but falling short of my 2:50 hopeful time.


### Post-race
A half hour later at home, while showering (after which I planned to eat and drink), I began to feel light-headed and nauseous at the same time and began to panic and breathe heavily. I cut my shower short, leaving the water running, and found my wife to tell her I was not okay. She quickly handed me a bottle of water and instructed me to lay on the couch and drink while she found the Powerade. I calmed down a little and then asked for something to eat, which helped a lot. Although I remember what happened and what I said, she thinks I was delirious for a short time. 

Although candy corn and water might suffice for a half marathon, I clearly need a more comprehensive replenishment strategy. I have tried gels in the past but either disliked them or experienced digestive issues. At a minimum, I'll be sure to have access to Powerade as I did for my longer practice runs.",running,foroccasionaluseonly,False,/r/running/comments/ifhcwy/eastern_states_20_miler/

I didn’t get injured so spare me.

Coworker bet me I couldn’t run a marathon with no training. Rules were I had to do it within two weeks and each mile under 11:30.

I’ve never ran more than 5 miles before and that was 7 years ago. I’m in my mid twenties and lift weights for exercise. I do not regularily run.


Ran by myself
Final time: 5:16:28 
Average pace 12:04
Distance: 26.2 miles

I wasn’t able to keep my splits under 11:30 so I lost the bet. At mile 14 my feet and knees were very swollen as they were not used to running.  

I had dropped off and hid water/Gatorade’s along the path prior. I still ran out of water and had to call my friend to resupply me at two points.

Definitely one of the most painful things I’ve done. Obviously not a smart decision to do this without training. 

I have never liked running but maybe am looking into starting a program and doing a marathon after a good training program.

I had a major surgery and am finally approaching the time when I can start running again. I had COVID-19 which put me out of running for a month, then ran for about 2 weeks, then had a major surgery which put me out of running (and any exercise except slowly walking) for a couple months. 

I'm going to be starting running again next week and I guess I just want some motivation, advice, encouragement, and/or person success stories. I have multiple chronic diseases, which made it difficult for me to run this year even before I caught COVID. I feel like I haven't ran in so long and even though I'm excited to start running again, I'm afraid I'll be discouraged about my pace/distance.

My surgery was on my abdomen and pelvis so I really couldn't do much while recovering because you need to use your core for EVERYTHING. I couldn't push/pull, I couldn't lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk, I could walk but very short distances and it would make me very tired, I couldn't even sit up on my own in a chair for 2 weeks and even then I couldn't do it for longer than an hour!

I'm a new(b) runner. Due to COVID, I've recently decided to take on Peloton's marathon training. I just finished up week 3 with a long run today; it's the longest I've ever run and was a blast (13km).

The reason I'm here is because I wanted to see if there was any advice on my training.

Prior to week 3, I had just been running as best I could and trying to keep a decent (for me) pace. I have a friend who was supporting me on Strava. We talk often so he asked me about my heart rate, saying how it was quite high during my runs.

He's pretty experienced when it comes to training and loves to use data to train. He introduced me to zone training and said that people often refer to training in my zone as ""junk miles"". Essentially, my heart rate was quite high. My training was not effective.

This week (week 3 out of 18) I started doing zone training. After a bit of quick research (and feedback from my friend) I started shooting for zone 2 during my runs. It's been a night and day difference. I come out of my runs feeling a lot less beat down. I can run much longer.

Working in zone 2 has been great but I am so darn slow. I guess I'm just looking for reassurance. I know I'm *training* now, not just *running*. But still, my ego hurts every time someone blazes past me.

Is there hope for me? Will my pace ever improve?

4804,4804,4804,51,Dodgy knees,1598220929,"DISCLAIMER: having fallen foul of rule 7 and had my painstakingly typed message unceremoniously deleted, I have modified it slightly and reposted in the hope it is allowed to stay this time. I am not seeking medical advice, merely a discussion surrounding my knee problems and similar problems others may be experiencing and what they are doing about it. 

I started running a little late in life. I was 40 when I started doing my local ParkRun five years ago. My first ever 5k was 32 minutes, within 6 months I'd got that down to a respectable 26:30. Initially, I just did the weekly ParkRun but soon realised I needed to do at least 3 x 5k runs per week if I wanted to improve my time. However, in early 2016 (around 9-10 months after I started running) I began to experience pain in both knees - in particular when walking up or down stairs. I ignored it at first as it tended to disappear a couple of days after a run and was never painful during a run.

As time progressed, the pain became more frequent and was eventually present during my runs too. Notably, my left knee is much better than my right. I went to see an osteopath who advised me to stop running for 4-6 weeks, ice my knees three times a day and do a variety of regular stretching (up to this point I had never warmed up or done any kind of stretching either before or after my runs).

The ice and pulling my leg up to my butt and holding for 30 seconds (repeated several times a day, every day) appeared to keep things in check for a while. I never did take a break from running, as was recommended. My knees were not perfect but the stabbing pain in the kneecaps was only occurring for a day or so after a 5k run then it would wear off.

In the past year or so I attempted to try a 10k run and foolishly did 10k straight off, without any gradual increase. And both my knees sure knew about it immediately after. It made both of them really sore for several weeks. This time the ice and stretching didn't really seem to help. I was still running a 5k every 2-3 days so eventually gave in and rested for just over a week. I saw an immediate improvement. For the first time in 3-4 years I could walk up and down stairs without any stabbing pains.

After my brief rest, I started running again and within a week, the pain returned as bad as it was before - although once again, far worse in my right knee. The left knee was barely noticeable and seemed to recover much quicker but the right knee has been a continual thorn in my side. More recently I thought I would try another break and rested for a full week. As before, my knees felt like brand new and when I did my next 5k it was the first time in several years that I ran without any pain at all and had no pain after the run. But as soon as I upped my runs to 3 per week once more, things went back to the way they were.

I've increased my stretching, taken up some cycling to complement the running and to give a workout to the other leg muscles. I've continued to ice both knees every evening for 30 minutes and I invested in a foam roller and roll my calves, glutes, inner thigh and ITB several times a week but nothing other than a total cessation from running seems to help. The ice can keep things manageable but never cures it.

I really don't want to stop running completely for 4-6 weeks but I've also reached the point where the pain in my right knee is uncomfortable and prevents me from enjoying my runs.

The osteopath said it was inflation around the patella casing the pain. Who else suffers this way and what exercises, stretching, rolling, or other activities are you going to combat it?

I should also point out I am a mild over-pronator and am on my third pair of running shoes since 2015. I started off with some Adidas neutral shoes with orthotic insoles, which were pretty good. My second pair were another pair of Adidas neutrals, with the same orthotics. My latest pair bought last summer are Brooks Adrenaline GTS 19s stability shoe but without the orthotics. I bought these as they were recommended for knee pain but didn't seem to make any difference - so I have ruled out my shoes being the root cause of the problem. Incidentally, the Brooks gave my a new pain on my left achilles tendon and blisters on both heels, neither of which I had experienced before. At the risk of going off on a tangent, I am thinking of getting some Asics Gel Kayano 27's when I next change them (I replace them every 12-18 months or so, or every 1000km in my case).

For example, I ran 8 miles on a trail one way, and it was like 100 degrees outside. No water, no food. I was very dizzy and my legs refused to move any further. I had no ability to run 8 miles back. I had to walk to a gas station and begged the woman for water. She didn't want to give me any because I have to pay 10 cents for the cup but after hesitation she decided to give me a cup.

This might be a bit long of a post. 
I’m hoping to get some advice or help on figuring out what’s going on with my Right Leg. 


Back in a January 2019 I had injured my back lifting a very heavy bag. 
That set me back ( no pun intended) 5 months of running comfortably. I still trained for two months before a marathon and successfully ran it. 

I then took from Aug-December off from running. Then started up more seriously with a run club in January of 2020. 

Was running 3-4 time’s a week with the run club at a slower 6km pace. 

My leg felt fine doing that pace. I then jumped to 5:45-5:30km pace and it was ok as well. 

Then Covid hit. Run club was cancelled. 

I went out on my own. Did some speed work.... way to fast speed work. 2.5-3km pace. 

Here is where the Injury started. 

My right leg just didn’t feel strong anymore. 
It basically feels like when I go to walk my leg goes to Pull up basically. 

It’s like my leg wants to go a different direction. 

I’ve been trying to do basic things for IT stuff. 
Like.... 
Glute exercises
core exercises ( not as much as I should be tho) 
Stretching 

The feeling is right around the outside of my right knee and goes a little further up about half way of my thigh on the outside. 

It comes and goes tho. And I can usually still run. But lately it’s been coming back the pain really fast. The next day after a run. 
And then I rest for 2-4 days and it goes away. 
I run again for a week and then it comes back. 


I’ve been to physio for it. They just say Strengthen your core. Well I’m doing my best to do that. And my best to strengthen my glutes. 
And still the injury persists. 

I’m at a loss. I miss being able to run without wondering if I’m gonna be injured the next day. I use to be able to run 4.5km pace no prob. Now if I run faster than 5:45km pace I feel it the next day.

4807,4807,4807,54,I’ve plateaued at 20 mile runs.,1598218597,"I’m in San Antonio, TX. Hot all the time, humid most of the time but not like Houston level humidity. I’ve been super struggling to go beyond 20 miles in a single run for the last month and a half. 

I wake up at 4:30am every Sunday so I can get half my run done before the sun is fully up and I go slow, averaging 13min/mile. It’s conversation pace for me, my husband rides his bike alongside me and we chat the whole time so I don’t think my issue is pace. 

I hydrate well. I drink an electrolyte drink the night before, as soon as I wake up day of, and then another during my run in addition to all the other normal water I drink. I do struggle with nutrition though and have felt light headed during my runs at certain points. 

I try to eat well the night before but I can’t really eat anything decent in the morning or else I’ll puke or just have a super uncomfortable burping fit while I run. I’ve been eating a 100kcal baby food squeeze pouch before my run and then I’ll eat one every hour of my hour. Since I started doing that,  no puking or burping fits. I prefer them over gu since they’re actually kind of nutritious. However, if I try to eat more then 1/hour and stay hydrated, my stomach gets sloshy and running becomes uncomfortable. I definitely don’t feel like I’ve perfected my long run nutrition by any means. 

Sometimes I can’t go beyond 20 because we got to the trail a little later then normal and the heat/humidity of running in the sun longer and later then normal stops me. Sometimes my nutrition issues keep me from running beyond 20. Today, we had the coolest morning in several months (68 degrees!) but humidity was high due to a storm the day before. I thought for sure today was the day I’d finally run beyond 20 miles but nope. Mentally, it was the easiest 20 mile run Ive done to date because the temp was pretty great. But my husband and I are renovating our house entirely ourselves and the day before I removed a ton of particularly hard to remove tile. My whole body was sore but my knees and hamstrings were particularly unhappy during my run this morning so I stopped at 20 miles once again. On a positive note, we saw two snakes, a baby skunk, and armadillo, and a large owl on the trail today! We also saw tons of toads and deer but they’re the normal cast of characters. 

I guess this is mostly a vent because I’m frustrated with my lack of progress and all my excuses but I’ll take any advice (particularly on nutrition if anyone has any!), commiserating, empathizing, etc anyone wants to offer.

4809,4809,4809,56,"29,F. 15K today!",1598217689,"Today I run my first 15K! Thanks Reddit!!

I (F, 29) could only run for 20 minutes a few years ago. My mind would just set small goals and running had no much purpose for me. I wanted to like running but it didn't really sink in me.

In May I started running. My goals were not distances but time  I wanted to be able to be running for at least 30 minutes. So I started adding 5 mins when it felt good and I was running 45 mins for a few weeks. Then, I joined this awesome Reddit and I discovered Strava, so it was nice to see my runs in a map after doing them. I didn't really care about speed or records, I just wanted to keep moving, not stopping and running for more time. There is a good feeling behind knowing that you can be running away from a danger for this amount of time and whenever I wear my running gear I feel powerful  and big, although I'm only 1,55m / 5.1feet. It's amazing the power Running gives!

Then, thanks again to some runners in this Reddit I found out about ""Run with Hal"" and I settled that I wanted to run 15K on the 31st August. 

I have been running 2-4 times per week following the Run with Hal plan and having 15K as a goal for the 31st August. I always run the amount of time set on the plan but I always was faster than the planned speed (I usually run 6 to 6.30km/h depending the altitude) and the plan wanted me to do a 8km/h. 

My trick (again, learned thanks to many Reddit runners) was to slow down if I thought I was fast or not comfortable enough.

Go slow.
This tip makes wonders and kept me going easily. My knees, which hurt a bit at the beginning of my plan, now only hurt a bit once I've run for an hour (the good hurt kind of hurt) And my lungs are great except when it's too hot (40°C/104°F) and humid. To be honest, when I finish my runs I feel ok, I don't feel tired and as soon as I stop running I can breath properly like if I wasn't tired. Should I push myself to run harder? Maybe. But I don't want to push myself too much and start hating running. 

Today:

 I had to run 1h 48' so I knew I was going to do 15K some time on my run. I did my way up a mountain that I always do but the way down that I always take was closed so I had 2 options: go back my way and down the mountain or keep going up the mountain. I chose the second and just kept running up the mountain. I was veeery slow but it was great. 

- Distance: 15,84 kilometres
- Time: 1.54h
- Average speed: 7,16/km
- Altitude run: 266m
- Music: Gaga + Sia (I also owe my runnings to these women) also I cannot run without music yet because I think that if I listen to myself breathing my mind will think that I'm too tired (which I'm not) and my mind won't be that strong to keep running 

If you have reached this point, thank you so much. I also owe this run to you all.


I'm afraid I will come back to this Reddit to keep reading you all and asking you tons of questions because I need to learn a lot from you yet.

I wish you all happy runs!

Running, without a doubt has been one of my only source of good hormones, which has kept me sane and fit. It has been the only thing which has been going right and regular in an otherwise uncertain and anxiety-inducing time. Lurking around for a while in this sub and reading about how running has impacted the lives of people has only given me more happiness and confidence to keep at it.

Before I go into my present issue, let me go a year into the past.

I signed up for a 5K organized by a local sports store, which was an attempt to gauge myself on my running ability. I started running almost every day about 6K as a practice for it about a month before the event. This was my first-time 'training' for any event and so without proper knowledge, I just went for it. No warm-up before the run or stretches post-run, no building up of distance/pace. Just plain running and tiring out each day, but not to the point I couldn't go the next day. A day before the event, I gave my all in for my run and managed to cover the distance of 6K in 30 minutes. I was happy with my time and I thought I could do pretty well for the event. After the run and even on the next day, I had slight persistent pain on my shin but thought it would wear off. It didn't! On the day of the 5K, I did a bit of stretching, started running and about halfway, I had an acute pain down my knee, through my shin to the foot. I literally couldn't run further, because, with each step, it started to sting. I managed to finish the event but disappointed.

The pain persisted, but I could only feel it when I ran or jumped or did something similar. I concluded that I might've had shin splints and never really ran for a year after that as most of what was out on the internet was that it was caused due to 'overuse' of my shinbone.

Fast-forward to April 2020, I slowly started running again, careful not to over-exert myself; with a good warm-up, stretches post running and few core workouts to remain fit during my stasis at home. I started by jogging in my backyard before really going out for the real run. When I finally did, I ran slowly, walked at other times about 2-3 times a week.

I finally picked up my pace and currently run 6K every two days without fail. I take a break for around 10-15 mins at the halfway (at 3K) which takes me around 15 mins on my fast days that I do every now and then. Other days, I go easy-moderate, trying to just enjoy the run and sweat.

Coming to the issue, after my runs, especially on my fast days, I still have a bit of pain somewhere on my shins. The pain pretty much wears off by the time I would have to go out for my next run, but a tinge of it would still be there. I do not think that it affects my performance much because it does not hinder my daily activities and some amount of that pain gives me a sense of 'having worked that muscle out', but it still remains to be perceptible. However, since I have had an episode of shin splints in the past, I would like to avoid any possibility of its recurrence.

I just would like to know if such a small amount of pain is normal and how much pain is too much? Before each run, I warm-up for about 5 minutes which includes wrist and ankles stretches, shoulder stretch, quad stretch, side lunges, butt kicks, high stepping etc. After each run, I stretch for the same amount of time which includes quad stretch, calf stretch, forward bend, kneeling lunge stretch, glute stretch, hamstring stretch etc. and I continue with a bit of workout including push-ups, plank, leg-raises, bicycle crunches, squats and burpees, spanning for about 20-30 mins.

Is there anything I am doing wrong or could do better? I don't know where else to post this or whom else to ask for advice as I'm pretty much the only one in my friends’ circle who have been regularly running.

### Training
I have been a runner for 8 years and prior to this, I had completed 10 half marathons. I decided to train for a full after I had a half canceled in April as my “quarantine project” since I had a lot more time to run while working from home. I utilized the Hal Higdon Novice 1 plan and picked it up from after the half marathon mark starting the last week of March. I ended up cycling through the plan a couple of times since races kept getting canceled, but finally found one that wasn’t canceled! I ended up running two 18 milers, a 19, and a 20 during training. I also strength trained by doing a megaformer class twice a week and did some hiking as cross training. 

### Pre-race
This race had a really creative setup in order to allow for social distancing. The race was held over 3 days and runners had to sign up for a 5 minute starting block which was limited to 8 runners every 5 minutes. All aid stations were grab and go bottled products. I signed up for the 5:30 AM Sunday spot to be able to run as early in the morning as possible! 

Packet pickup was the day before the race at an outdoor booth, and to limit touch points, they also distributed medals and finisher shirts at pick up. The night before the race, I had a dinner of rice and steelhead trout and went to bed around 8. I woke up at 2:30 on race day and had my typical pre-race banana, bagel, and peanut butter along with some coffee, Powerade, and water. The goal was to start running as soon as you got to the starting line to avoid congregating, so we showed up to the starting line, I used the toilet, and off I went!

### Race
Holy hills Batman. This race was extremely hilly, with more immediate inclines and declines than I expected from the elevation map. The course itself was well marked, and consisted of two out and back sections, with the start and finish line somewhere in between the two. I started out feeling great, despite the hills. The aid stations for the marathon only section were about 4 miles apart, so I did end up carrying my own water and fuel to supplement. I tried to bank as much time on the downhills as possible to make up for the uphills I knew I would have on the way back. 

The course itself was beautiful with great views of the lake. The benefit of a socially distanced run was that there was no initial bobbing and weaving which was great—my watch ended up being right in sync with the mile markers. 

The race utilized the race joy app to try to make up for the limited to no spectators along the course. Through the app, people can track you and send cheers, and it gave turn by turn guidance of the course. Unfortunately, my app stopped working about 16 miles in, so I missed a lot of the updates and cheers. The app is a cool idea, but seems a bit buggy.

It was definitely different than a typical race environment. During the marathon only leg, I saw very few other runners, and only a couple of spectators (really one group that was following someone running near me to replenish water/fuel given the limited aid stations). The grab and go drinks are totally understandable, but it was then awkward having to carry a full bottle for the next several miles. I actually ended up walking around mile 18 in order to dump water into my hydration pack because it was so difficult to run holding the bottle. The plus side was that I was able to stay plenty hydrated! I also took in a half pack of sport beans every couple of miles, and subbed a half of a honey stinger waffle at 12 and 18 miles. 

Everyone warned me about the last 10K being it’s own race, but wow was I not ready. The extended hill also didn’t help. I did allow myself to walk for 30 seconds to a minute at the mile marks during the last 10K (probably walked a total of .2-.3 miles), but I did at least manage to never stop completely and ran the final 1.5 miles straight. I definitely felt the wall and had some lightheadedness—it really took everything in me to just keep my legs running and I don’t think I could have gone any faster if I had wanted to. Sub-4 had been a huuuge stretch goal for me anyway, so I was okay with just finishing strong at that point, and I still blew away my “real” goals in the end. Still, I was grateful to see my family at the 25.9 mile mark, and ecstatic to finally cross the finish line!

### Post-race
Elevated my legs, took some pics, then came home to shower and eat. About to take a glorious and much needed nap! I am quite sore (no surprise there!)

4826,4826,4826,74,My roommate dropped me off in the middle of nowhere and I had to run my way back home,1598210571,"Inspired by a comment on an earlier post, I asked my roommate to drive me about 11.5 miles out of town into bumfuck nowhere, Wyoming (okay, not super middle of nowhere, but WY is empty the moment you leave town). The only way to get back home would be to either run or hitchhike. 

I was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a run it was. I had never been down this road before and as a geologist I had a lovely time looking at all the exposed bedrock. I had a light edible beforehand and hardly noticed the first hour of the run, keeping about a 10:30 pace. I started a bit in the mountains, so the constant downhill certainly helped! 

After the first hour, I started to feel fatigued from the very heavy wildfire haze currently covering much of the western US. My motivation was dropping fast, but the one thing that kept me going was that I simply had no choice. Either I keep running, or I stop and wither in the sagebrush. Soon after, at around the 7 mile mark, I started to recognize where I was from previous long runs which gave me the focus to keep going. A brief 1 minute walk to catch my breath, and I was feeling very confident in my ability to finish strong. The little valley in my pace (below) was when I had to stop at a crosswalk. 

A day of recovery later, I would absolutely do this kind of run again and strongly recommend it to everyone who runs longer distances. Often, you will see new sights that are just too far to get to if you are going out and back, and at the very least it forces you to get the mileage in. There is no turning back early, thinking ""maybe this isn't my day.""

I do not think that it affects my performance much because it does not hinder my daily activities and some amount of that pain gives me a sense of 'having worked that muscle out', but it still remains to be perceptible. However, since I have had an episode of shin splints in the past, I would like to avoid any possibility of its recurrence.

I just would like to know if such a small amount of pain is normal and how much pain is too much? Before each run, I warm-up for about 5 minutes which includes wrist and ankles stretches, shoulder stretch, quad stretch, side lunges, butt kicks, high stepping etc. After each run, I stretch for the same amount of time which includes quad stretch, calf stretch, forward bend, kneeling lunge stretch, glute stretch, hamstring stretch etc. and I continue with a bit of workout including push-ups, plank, leg-raises, bicycle crunches, squats and burpees, spanning for about 20-30 mins.

Is there anything I am doing wrong or could do better? I don't know where else to post this or whom else to ask for advice as I'm pretty much the only one in my friends’ circle who have been regularly running.

4835,4835,4835,83,5 minute mile &amp; beach running,1598208460,"So here’s my story in a nutshell. I’m a 31yo male in good shape. I have consistently lifted for most of adult life, however I have done very little to no cardio for most of my adult life. My calves are the one part of my body which I just can’t grow with conventional workouts. so, I finally relented and said I will try running to build my calves. I ran a couple times on the beach about a mile or so, and it is definitely giving my calves a workout like none other. So, after those two runs I said let me try the road and see what my two mile time is. Got .7 miles in and looked at my time and to my surprise noticed I could possibly crack 6 min (I was hoping to just crack 7min), and said f the two mile and started running as hard as I could to break a 6min mile. Ended up getting a 5:58 mile. I think if I had started pacing for a mile from the get-go I could have maybe shaved 10 seconds off. So after that, I felt f’ing great. Woke up the next morning thinking about it and wanting to hit a 5min mile now. I could never understand how so many people seemingly *love* running, now I get it. I want to continue running on the beach (feels better) and then hit the road every now and then to gauge where I’m at. 

So any advice on the quickest way to hit the 5 minute mile if I’m beach running? I have searched previous posts, and there were actually more people than I expected not recommending it. I personally feel great after running on the beach, zero discomfort in the knees afterwards. Is training hard on the beach a bad idea?

4838,4838,4838,86,Please give me training advice to run 5-miles in 30 minutes before the end of the year,1598206706,"Hi guys. I hope you are well. I am a 28-year-old male who is getting into running. Having a goal to strive towards makes things more enjoyable for me so I have settled upon 5-miles in 30 minutes after 4 months of training. I know it is very ambitious so I would be extremely grateful for your advice. 

Right now, I am able to run 15 laps (3.75 miles) in 30 minutes. I did that on a quarter mile track this past Thursday and it was very difficult. I think the following changes might make 5-miles in 30 minutes possible: 1) losing 30 pounds; 2) making a serious improvement in cardiovascular fitness since I am now just starting out; 3) improving running form; and 4) getting mentally tougher and gaining the ability to push myself harder. I only want to be able to run 5-miles in 30 minutes just once after going all out before the year is out. It's not something I expect I'll be able to do anytime I want. 

Any advice on how I should structure my training would be great. I am only able to run 3x/week. Should I just go for the same max-effort 30-minute run each time? Or should i do something slightly different each day? Perhaps it's not necessary to go as hard as I can each time? Any and all advice is welcome.

4839,4839,4839,87,Took a Third of a Tab of Acid and Ran My First Half Marathon.,1598205618,"I read a post on here a while ago about people taking low doses of LSD and running and was pretty intrigued by the idea. It seemed like a possible way to reach a flow state and really lose yourself in a run. Plus I figured the combination of a mild acid high and the exercise induced endorphins would have me feeling pretty good. So yesterday I woke up, cut a third off a tab and ate it. Then I ate some oatmeal with fruit, had a cup of black coffee and drank a few glasses of water, put a playlist together and headed out the door.

It had been about an hour since I took the acid by the time I got going. I could tell I was in a slightly altered head space at this point, but wasn't really feeling the acid much. My goal was to break my previous distance PR of 15k and go for ten miles.

Honestly, it's hard for me to say how much of an impact the LSD had on my run. I started off on one of my regular 10k routes and was initially unsure if I'd reach my goal because my legs were feeling kind of sore, but by mile five I was feeling good and grooving to the music, although I didn't feel noticably different than I do on my longer runs.

The high point of the run was around mile eight. I was running up a hill listening to [Mothership Connection by Parliament](https://youtu.be/sSERB93GYfw) and was hit by a wave of euphoria. I felt very in tune with my body and at that point I felt like I could run forever. It was at this point when I started considering going for the half marathon.

I started to hit a wall during the last two miles. I was a little concerned about hydration as I was soaked in sweat and I had already drank the approximately 12oz of water I brought with me. I was so close to my goal though and decided to keep going. I powered through and ended up **finishing the half marathon with a time of about 1:51.**

It was only when I stopped running that I realized how high I actually. As I was in my kitchen making a smoothie colors were really popping, much more than they had been on the run, and I could tell I was mildy tripping. All in all it was a good experience, but I probably won't do it again; running is enough of a trip on its own. If I do ever go on another LSD run, however, I'd probably go with a higher dose so I can really appreciate the psychedelic experience.",running,Thegoodlife93,False,/r/running/comments/if7u1b/took_a_third_of_a_tab_of_acid_and_ran_my_first/

4847,4847,4847,96,Should I slow down so that I can enjoy running again?,1598197867,"Hi thanks for looking at my post! So I used to be on the cross country team. My fastest time was 6:30 min per mile (4:02 per km), and on average I would run a 7 min mile (4:20 per km). We ran about 35 miles per week and I was really enjoying it. 

But then I got an injury about a year ago so I took a break from running. I started running again about 2 months ago, but I’m stuck at 8:30 min miles (5:16 per km). I know that it’s going to take a while to get back into shape, but I’m really hating running right now. I run 5 (8 km) miles, 3 days a week. I’d say that this is moderately hard for me. It’s not extreme, but it’s definitely easy. 

I’m wondering if I should slow down, maybe to 9 min per mile so I can enjoy running again. I miss feeling invincible when I run. Now I’m just tired and out of breath and hating every second of it. 

I eventually want to rejoin the cross country team and run faster, but my ultimate goal is just to be healthy and enjoy running again. 

Ps. I never listen to anything while I run but I’m considering it. Do you think that listening to something helps you to enjoy running more?
